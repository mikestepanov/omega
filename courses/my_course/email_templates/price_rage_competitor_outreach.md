## Title
Price Rage Competitor Outreach

## Description

**When to Use:**
Deploy this template within 24-48 hours of a competitor announcing price increases, plan changes, or new paid tiers. Most effective for sudden increases (>20%), elimination of grandfathered pricing, or retroactive policy changes. Monitor competitor blogs, pricing pages, and customer forums for announcements.

**How to Execute:**
1. Set up Google Alerts for "[Competitor] pricing" and "[Competitor] price increase"
2. Monitor competitor status pages and blogs for announcements
3. Track social media sentiment - look for customer complaints about costs
4. Send emails while the pain is fresh (within 48 hours max)
5. Use specific discount codes to track conversions from this campaign

**Why It Works:**
Price increases create immediate budget stress and force customers to reevaluate their tools. People are most receptive to alternatives when they're actively angry about unexpected costs. The timing is crucial - customers are already researching alternatives, so you're meeting them at the perfect moment in their decision-making process. This template works because it acknowledges their frustration and positions you as a solution, not just another vendor.

**Real Examples:**
- **Unity's Runtime Fee Disaster (Sept 2023)**: Announced charging per game install after certain thresholds, retroactively. Result: Godot's funding DOUBLED from €25k to €47k/month in just weeks. Re-Logic donated $100,000 to Godot in protest
- **Heroku Kills Free Tier (Aug 2022)**: Eliminated free dynos and free Postgres databases affecting thousands of hobby projects. Result: Mass migration to alternatives like Render, Railway, and Fly.io
- **Docker Desktop Enterprise Tax (Aug 2021)**: Required paid subscriptions for companies >250 employees or >$10M revenue. Result: Mass exodus to Podman, Lima, and Colima as free alternatives
- **Mailchimp's Audience Pricing (May 2022)**: Switched from subscriber count to "audience" count (includes unsubscribed). Result: Users faced 100%+ price increases overnight, paying for contacts they can't even email

## Subject
Saw [COMPETITOR]'s price jump to $[NEW_PRICE]

## Body
Hi [NAME],

**You'll save $[SAVINGS]/month by switching from [COMPETITOR] to us - migration takes just 10 minutes.**
**Plus, we guarantee no price increases for 24 months (get it in writing).**

I get it - nobody likes surprise price increases. Especially [INCREASE_PERCENT] overnight.

I saw your [POST/REVIEW/COMMENT] about [COMPETITOR]'s new pricing. That jump from $[OLD_PRICE] to $[NEW_PRICE] probably just blew up your [MONTHLY/ANNUAL] budget planning, right?

We built [YOUR_PRODUCT] specifically for teams like yours who need [CORE_VALUE] without enterprise pricing. Our [COMPARABLE_PLAN] is $[YOUR_PRICE] and includes everything you're probably using now.

Quick question - what features do you actually use in [COMPETITOR]? I ask because 90% of teams switching to us only use [COMMON_FEATURES], which we've had since day one.

Fun fact: Remember when Unity announced their runtime fee? Godot's user base literally doubled in one month. Price increases always trigger migrations.

If you're worried about migration headaches, don't be. We have a tool that imports your [DATA_TYPE] in about 10 minutes. Your team won't even notice the switch.

Want to see if we're a fit? Here's my calendar: [CALENDAR_LINK]

BTW, we have a freemium tier that includes [CORE_FEATURES] - no credit card required. You can test everything before committing.

P.S. Two offers for you:
1. Use code [COMPETITOR_NAME]_REFUGE_1MONTH for your first month free on any paid plan
2. Post about switching to us on LinkedIn/Twitter and tag us = 6 extra months free. Seriously. We love the social proof, you get 7 months total free. Win-win.
