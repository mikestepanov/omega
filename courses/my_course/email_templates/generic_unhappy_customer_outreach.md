## Title
Generic Unhappy Customer Outreach

## Description

**When to Use:**
Deploy for general dissatisfaction that doesn't fit other categories: complexity complaints, feature bloat, poor user experience, or "looking for alternatives" posts. Most effective when customers are venting frustrations without specific incidents. Target community discussions, comparison shopping posts, or general negativity about tools.

**How to Execute:**
1. Monitor Reddit communities, Hacker News, and industry forums for general complaints
2. Look for posts like "Alternative to [Competitor]?" or "[Competitor] is getting worse"
3. Search for phrases like "too complex," "bloated," "overkill," "frustrated with"
4. Join relevant Slack communities and Discord servers where users discuss tools
5. Respond with genuine curiosity, not immediate sales pitches
6. Focus on understanding their specific pain points before positioning your solution

**Why It Works:**
General unhappiness often represents deeper, systemic issues that customers haven't fully articulated yet. This template works because it leads with empathy and curiosity rather than assumptions. By asking what's broken instead of telling them you can fix it, you gather valuable intelligence about their specific needs while positioning yourself as someone who actually listens. This consultative approach builds trust and often reveals pain points you can uniquely address. The softer touch increases response rates because it feels like a conversation, not a sales pitch.

**Real Examples:**
- **"Jira is Too Complex" Sentiment**: Common complaints about complexity exist across forums and communities. Competitors position themselves as simpler alternatives "for humans"
- **"Salesforce is Overkill" for SMBs**: Common complaint about being overly complex and expensive for small businesses. Competitors target this with "CRM for humans, not enterprises" messaging
- **"Photoshop is Bloated" Designer Complaints**: Widespread complaints about bloat, clutter, and lost focus on core features. Figma and other alternatives gaining significant market share
- **"QuickBooks is Confusing" Small Business Pain**: Common complaint about being overly complex for small businesses. Articles document user frustration with complexity

**What Happens Next:**
- **If they download guide**: Follow up asking which alternative looks best
- **If they reply with pain points**: Address specifically with demo
- **If they go quiet**: Share success story from similar company
- **If they choose competitor**: Offer help anyway (builds goodwill)

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Don't immediately pitch your solution
- Don't dismiss their frustrations as minor
- Don't send generic comparison - personalize it
- Don't forget to actually be helpful (even if they don't buy)
- Don't assume their use case - ask questions

Hey [NAME],

**500+ teams switched using this guide - most found their solution in under an hour.**

I help companies switch from [COMPETITOR] when it's not working out.

Saw your post about [COMPETITOR] in [COMMUNITY/FORUM]. You mentioned [SPECIFIC_QUOTE_OR_PAIN_POINT] - that resonated with me because we hear this a lot.

Curious - what's the main thing pushing you to look elsewhere? Is it:
- The [COMMON_PAIN_1: pricing / complexity / performance]?
- Missing [COMMON_PAIN_2: features / integrations / support]?
- Or something else entirely?

I ask because we built [YOUR_PRODUCT] after getting frustrated with the same issues. Some of our happiest customers are refugees from [COMPETITOR] who just wanted [SIMPLE_DESIRE: something that works / fair pricing / actual support].

No sales pitch. Just genuinely curious what's broken in [INDUSTRY]. The insights help us build better products.

If you want to compare notes on [COMPETITOR] alternatives, here's a guide we put together: [RESOURCE_LINK]. Includes honest pros/cons of 6 options (including ours).

Happy to share what we've learned from helping hundreds of teams make the switch.

BTW - you can try us risk-free. Our freemium tier includes [ESSENTIAL_FEATURES]. No credit card, no sales calls, just create an account and start using it.

Cheers,
[YOUR_NAME]
