## Title
Outage Opportunity Outreach

## Description

**When to Use:**
Strike within 1-2 hours of a competitor experiencing significant downtime (>30 minutes), widespread service degradation, or repeated reliability issues. Most effective during business hours when the impact is highest. Target outages affecting core functionality that businesses depend on daily.

**How to Execute:**
1. Set up monitoring: DownDetector alerts, competitor status page RSS feeds, Twitter alerts for "[Competitor] down"
2. Pre-write template variants for different outage types (authentication, data access, full service)
3. Keep emergency trial accounts ready for instant provisioning
4. Have your technical team on standby to assist with rapid migrations
5. Follow up within 24 hours if the outage continues or happens again
6. Track which customers converted and their usage patterns

**Why It Works:**
Outages create immediate business continuity crises. When customers can't access critical data or services, they're forced to find alternatives RIGHT NOW - not next quarter. This template works because you're offering a lifeline during a genuine emergency. The key is being helpful, not opportunistic. By providing immediate relief and demonstrating your reliability during their crisis, you build tremendous goodwill and trust that often leads to long-term switches.

**Real Examples:**
- **Slack's 5-Hour Meltdown (Feb 2022)**: Global outage during work hours affecting millions of daily users. Impact: Teams worldwide couldn't communicate for an entire morning. Competitors saw immediate trial signups
- **Notion's DNS Outage (Feb 2021)**: Hours-long outage when domain registrar Hexonet suspended notion.so after phishing complaints. Impact: Users locked out of all their documents. Local-first alternatives gained permanent converts
- **AWS us-east-1 Goes Dark (Dec 2021)**: Major outage taking down Disney+, Netflix, and countless services. Impact: Billions in lost revenue across affected companies. Other cloud providers gained enterprise customers
- **GitHub's Week of Pain (March 2022)**: Multiple outages March 16-23 due to MySQL cluster issues. Impact: GitLab's viral "GitHub is down" page became their most effective marketing ever. Self-hosted solutions saw renewed interest

**What Happens Next:**
- **If they click emergency link**: Be ready to assist with setup immediately
- **If they text/call**: Respond within 5 minutes during business hours
- **If they start trial**: Send quick-start guide and offer screen share
- **After crisis**: Schedule reliability comparison demo

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Don't gloat about competitor's problems
- Don't overpromise on setup time
- Don't forget this is a crisis - be helpful, not salesy
- Don't claim 100% uptime (nobody believes it)
- Don't forget to follow up after the outage ends

**Social Proof Elements:**
"Join 1,200+ teams who switched after outages cost them real money"
"GitLab gained 10K users during GitHub's last major outage"
"See why TechCrunch called us 'the reliable alternative'"

## When to Use This Template
- During active competitor outages (within 1-2 hours)
- After repeated reliability issues
- When competitors have poor uptime track records
- During critical business hours when impact is highest

## Response Time Guidelines
- **Initial outreach**: Within 2 hours of outage start
- **Follow-up**: Next business day if outage continues
- **Final check-in**: After 48 hours with uptime comparison

## Value Proposition (First 2 Lines)
**Save Time**: Get back online in 2 minutes with our emergency account
**Reduce Risk**: 99.9% uptime means <9 hours downtime per YEAR (not per incident)
