## Title
Bad Support Recovery

## Description

**When to Use:**
Reach out to customers actively complaining about poor support experiences: multi-day response times, ticket escalation failures, unhelpful chatbots, or expensive support tiers. Most effective when you can reference specific incidents or ongoing frustrations. Target users posting on social media, forums, or review sites about support issues.

**How to Execute:**
1. Monitor Twitter, Reddit, and review sites for support complaints about competitors
2. Set up alerts for "[Competitor] support terrible," "waiting X days," "no response"
3. Check G2, Trustpilot, and Capterra reviews filtered by "support" complaints
4. Look for forum posts about unresolved tickets or billing/technical issues
5. Respond within hours while the frustration is peak
6. Offer concrete proof of your superior support (response times, direct contacts, SLAs)

**Why It Works:**
Bad support creates deep, lasting frustration that goes beyond just the immediate issue. When customers feel ignored or mistreated, they start questioning the entire relationship with their vendor. This template works because support quality is highly emotional - it's about feeling heard and respected. By offering immediate human connection and demonstrating your commitment to actually helping (not just selling), you create a stark contrast with their current experience. Support issues often become the final straw that drives switching decisions.

**Real Examples:**
- **Note on Support Issues**: While specific support quality events for some vendors could not be independently verified, general review sites show patterns of customer frustration with support response times and quality across the industry
- **Adobe Creative Cloud's Support Challenges**: Price increases up to 50% with auto-renewal. Cancellation fees over $100 not clearly stated. FTC investigation revealed executive called fees "heroin for Adobe". Phone support only available on expensive tiers
- **AWS Enterprise Support Cost**: Minimum $15,000/month ($180,000/year). Tiered pricing: 10% of first $150K, 7% of $150-500K, 5% of $500K-1M, 3% above $1M. Common complaint: "Cost is a killer" for small/medium enterprises
- **Industry Pattern**: Many enterprise vendors reserve quality support for high-paying tiers, leaving smaller customers frustrated. Competitors differentiate by offering accessible support to all customers

- Adobe: FTC investigation and pricing documentation show support access limited by tier
- AWS: [AWS Support Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/pricing/) shows Enterprise support minimum $15,000/month

**What Happens Next:**
- **If they test support**: Ensure sub-2-hour response (track closely)
- **If they respond**: Share support metrics dashboard
- **If they mention specific issue**: Offer to solve it during demo
- **After demo**: Provide support SLA in writing

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Don't promise support response times you can't maintain
- Don't badmouth competitor's support team (blame the system)
- Don't hide your support tiers/limitations
- Don't forget they're already frustrated - be extra patient
- Don't automate responses to this template

**Social Proof Elements:**
"2,500+ refugees from [COMPETITOR]'s support nightmare"
"Median response time: 37 minutes (public dashboard: [LINK])"
"Even our CEO does support rotations - it keeps us honest"

## When to Use This Template
- After customers complain about support wait times
- When competitors limit support to expensive tiers
- Following support horror stories on social media
- During peak frustration (within hours of complaints)

## Response Time Guidelines
- **Initial outreach**: Within 2-4 hours of complaint
- **Follow-up**: Next business day
- **Support test**: Respond to their test within promised timeframe

## Value Proposition (First 2 Lines)
**Save Time**: Get support responses in 37 minutes, not days

Hi [NAME],

**Get support responses in 37 minutes instead of [WAIT_TIME] days - from real engineers, not scripts.**
**Test us: Send any question to support@[DOMAIN] right now. If we take >2 hours, I'll personally call to apologize.**

Yikes - [WAIT_TIME] days for a response on [ISSUE_TYPE]? That's rough.

I saw your [PLATFORM: Twitter thread / Reddit post / review] about [SPECIFIC_ISSUE]. Being stuck without [CRITICAL_FUNCTION] for that long must've been incredibly frustrating. Especially when you're paying $[AMOUNT]/month.

Here's how we handle support differently:
- Median response: 37 minutes (tracked publicly: [METRICS_LINK])
- Real engineers answer tickets, not tier-1 script readers
- Slack Connect available for [PLAN_LEVEL] and up
- My direct line for emergencies: [PHONE]

I know switching tools because of bad support feels like rewarding incompetence. But your [TEAM_SIZE]-person team deserves better than waiting [WAIT_TIME] days for basic help.

Want to test our support before committing? Send any technical question to support@[DOMAIN]. Time us. If we take over 2 hours, I'll personally call you to apologize.

We can migrate your data this week. Takes about [MIGRATION_TIME] with our tool.
