## Title
Deprecated Feature Alternative Outreach

## Description

**When to Use:**
Deploy within 1-2 weeks of competitors announcing feature removals, functionality deprecation, or moving capabilities to higher tiers. Most effective when the removed feature is workflow-critical or has no easy workaround. Target features that have dedicated user communities or frequent forum discussions.

**How to Execute:**
1. Monitor competitor changelogs, release notes, and deprecation announcements
2. Set up alerts for terms like "sunset," "deprecated," "moving to Pro," "no longer supported"
3. Identify users actively discussing the feature removal on Reddit, forums, or social media
4. Create feature comparison charts highlighting your continued support
5. Document your feature roadmap to show long-term commitment
6. Reach out before the removal takes effect, while users are still evaluating alternatives

**Why It Works:**
Feature removals feel like betrayals to users who've built workflows around those capabilities. Unlike price increases, you can't just pay more to keep the feature - it's gone forever. This creates a unique urgency because users must find alternatives or change their entire process. Your template works because you're offering stability and continuity when their current provider is taking away something they depend on. The key is emphasizing that you won't pull the rug out from under them like their current vendor just did.

**Real Examples:**
- **Evernote's 2-Device Limit (2016)**: Restricted free users from syncing across phone/tablet/computer. Previously allowed unlimited devices on free plan. Forced users to find alternatives
- **Zoom's 40-Minute Limit**: Enforces strict 40-minute limit on free meetings with 3+ participants. Forces upgrades for longer meetings. Key pain point for remote teams
- **LastPass Free Plan Changes (March 2021)**: Forced free users to choose mobile OR desktop, not both. Previously allowed unlimited devices. Created immediate migration pressure
- **Dropbox 3-Device Limit (2019)**: Limited free accounts to 3 devices max. Previously allowed unlimited devices. Pushed multi-device users to paid plans or competitors

**What Happens Next:**
- **If they watch video**: Follow up with specific use case demo
- **If they book call**: Prepare workflow preservation plan
- **If they start free tier**: Send migration guide immediately
- **After migration**: Document their workflow for case study

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Don't promise features you might remove later
- Don't assume you know their use case - ask first
- Don't rush them - feature removal creates natural urgency
- Don't forget to show YOUR feature roadmap transparency
- Don't mock competitor (they might reverse decision)

**Social Proof Elements:**
"3,000+ teams trust us to keep core features stable"
"Our oldest features are 5+ years and still free"
"Read our feature stability guarantee: [LINK]"

Noticed [COMPETITOR] just sunset [FEATURE]. I bet that threw a wrench in your [WORKFLOW/PROCESS].

I saw your [POST/COMMENT] about needing [SPECIFIC_USE_CASE]. That feature is probably core to how your team [SPECIFIC_BENEFIT: tracks projects / manages deployments / analyzes data], right?

Here's the thing: We've had [FEATURE] since 2019, and it's not going anywhere. In fact, we just improved it last month with [RECENT_IMPROVEMENT].

Want to know the real reason [COMPETITOR] killed it? It's expensive to maintain at scale. But we're not trying to squeeze every penny - we'd rather keep customers happy for years than optimize quarterly earnings.

If you want to see how our [FEATURE] works:
- 3-minute demo video: [VIDEO_LINK]
- Or jump on a quick call: [CALENDAR_LINK]

We'll even help you export your data from [COMPETITOR] and get it running here. Usually takes about an hour.

Want me to show you how it works on our side?

Good news: [FEATURE] is available on our freemium tier. You can start using it today, no payment required. We believe core features should be accessible to everyone.

P.S. We put our feature roadmap in writing. [FEATURE] is protected: [ROADMAP_LINK]

P.P.S. Ready for paid features?
1. [COMPETITOR_NAME]_REFUGE_1MONTH = first month free
2. Share your migration story on social media + tag us = 6 months free. Total: 7 months free. We'll even help you write the post if writer's block hits.
