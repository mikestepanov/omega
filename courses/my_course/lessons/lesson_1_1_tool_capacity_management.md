# Lesson 1.1: Tool Capacity Management - Maximizing Your Free Credits

## Title
Tool Capacity Management - Work Smarter with Limited Credits

## Description
Now that you've signed up for all 15 tools (Lesson 0.2), let's master credit management. This lesson shows you exactly how to stretch free tiers for maximum impact and when to strategically use each tool.

## The Credit Reality Check

Forget the "unlimited leads" promise. Here's what you actually get monthly:

**Email Finding Total**: ~225 emails/month
- Hunter.io: 25
- Clearbit: 100  
- Snov.io: 50
- FindThatLead: 50

**Web Monitoring**: ~150 checks/month
- Browse.ai: 50 credits
- Visualping: 150 (5/day)

**Enrichment**: 100-300 records (depending on tool)
**Automation**: 1,100 operations (Zapier + Make)

That's enough for 1-2 focused campaigns, not an empire.

## Credit Management Strategies

### 1. The Waterfall Method

Never burn credits on the same lead twice. Process in this order:

**Round 1 - Clearbit (Free 100)**
- Best for: Tech companies, startups
- Export found emails immediately
- Mark "not found" for next tool

**Round 2 - Hunter.io (25 credits)**  
- Best for: Domain searches
- Use for high-value targets Clearbit missed
- Better at finding CEOs/founders

**Round 3 - Snov.io (50 credits)**
- Different data sources than above
- Good for international companies
- Save for verified high-intent leads

**Round 4 - FindThatLead (50 credits)**
- Last resort for must-have contacts
- Good at finding personal emails
- Use sparingly

### 2. Credit Reset Calendar

Create calendar reminders for these reset dates:

**Monthly Resets** (Most tools):
- Set reminder 2 days before reset
- Use remaining credits on backup searches
- Don't let credits expire unused

**Daily Resets**:
- Visualping: 5 checks refresh at midnight
- Use for time-sensitive monitoring

**No Reset** (One-time trials):
- Lemlist 14-day trial
- Instantly trial
- Use these for big pushes

### 3. Credit Multiplication Tactics

**Bulk Operations Save Credits**:
- Hunter.io: Domain search (1 credit) finds multiple emails
- Don't waste credits on individual lookups
- Always search company domain first

**Smart Monitoring**:
- Browse.ai: Monitor one page with multiple data points
- Don't create separate monitors for each element
- One credit can track 10+ competitor changes

**Enrichment Hacks**:
- Clay: Enrich once, reuse data multiple times
- Export enriched data immediately
- Build your own database to avoid re-enrichment

### 4. When to Use Which Tool

**High-Value Targets** (C-suite, decision makers):
1. Start with Clearbit (highest accuracy)
2. Cross-verify with Hunter.io
3. Final attempt with manual LinkedIn + email permutator

**Bulk Campaigns** (100+ contacts):
1. Domain search in Hunter.io first
2. Bulk enrich survivors in Clay
3. Skip individual lookups entirely

**Time-Sensitive** (Price changes, outages):
1. Browse.ai for complex monitoring
2. Visualping for simple visual changes
3. Google Alerts for keyword mentions (unlimited)

### 5. Credit Conservation Rules

**Never Do This**:
- ❌ Look up the same email twice
- ❌ Monitor pages that rarely change
- ❌ Enrich before qualifying interest
- ❌ Use credits on info@/support@ emails

**Always Do This**:
- ✅ Export everything immediately
- ✅ Check your own database first
- ✅ Batch similar operations
- ✅ Screenshot credit balances weekly

## Building Your Credit Dashboard

Track everything in one spreadsheet:

| Tool | Credits Used | Credits Left | Reset Date | Best Use Case |
|------|--------------|--------------|------------|---------------|
| Hunter.io | 12 | 13 | Oct 15 | Domain searches |
| Clearbit | 67 | 33 | Oct 1 | Tech companies |
| Browse.ai | 23 | 27 | Oct 8 | Price monitoring |

Add conditional formatting:
- Red when <20% credits remain
- Yellow when <50% remain
- Green when fresh reset

## The Reality of Scaling

**Month 1-2**: Live within free tiers
- 1-2 campaigns
- 200-300 leads total
- Learn what converts

**Month 3+**: Selective upgrades
- Upgrade ONE tool that's working
- Usually Hunter.io or Clay first
- $49/month gets you 10x credits

**Never**: Upgrade everything at once
- That's $500+/month immediately
- Most tools will go unused
- Upgrade based on proven ROI

## Emergency Credit Strategies

**Out of credits mid-campaign?**

1. **Email Permutator** (0 credits):
   - firstname@company.com
   - f.lastname@company.com
   - Verify with free email checker

2. **Manual LinkedIn** (0 credits):
   - Find person on LinkedIn
   - Guess email format
   - Verify with mail tester

3. **Google Dorking** (0 credits):
   - site:company.com email
   - "contact" filetype:pdf site:company.com
   - Often reveals email patterns

## Action Items

1. Create your credit tracking spreadsheet
2. Set calendar reminders for all reset dates
3. Export last month's data from all tools
4. Calculate your true monthly capacity
5. Plan campaigns around credit limits

**Remember**: Free tiers are for testing and small campaigns. Don't believe the "10k leads per month free" hype. Be realistic, track everything, and upgrade strategically based on results.
