# Lesson 8.2: Case Study - From 0 to $20K MRR

## Title
Case Study - From 0 to $20K MRR

## Description
Real story of building a competitor intelligence agency from scratch. See exact emails sent, clients closed, mistakes made, and how to reach $20K monthly recurring revenue in 90 days.

## Video Script
"Let me tell you the real story of how I went from zero to $20,000 monthly recurring revenue in 90 days using this exact system. Not the highlight reel - the actual messy journey with real numbers, real emails, and real failures.

It started when I was freelancing and noticed a client's competitor having massive issues. I sent them 10 hot leads from angry customers. They closed 2 deals worth $100K. That's when I realized this wasn't just a tactic - it was a business.

But scaling from one lucky win to a real service business? That's where things got interesting. I'll show you the exact cold email that landed my first paying client, the pricing mistakes that cost me $50K, the hire that changed everything, and the systems that finally made it sustainable.

This isn't theory - it's a play-by-play breakdown of building a competitor intelligence agency, including the stuff nobody talks about: the client who fired us after one week, the month we almost went broke, and the breakthrough that made everything click.

Let's build your $20K MRR business, learning from my expensive mistakes."

## Month 0: The Discovery

### The Accidental Beginning

**The Origin Story**:
```
Context:
- Doing generic marketing consulting
- Client paying $2K/month for "growth"
- Results were... mediocre

The Breakthrough Moment:
Saw their competitor raised prices 40%
→ Found 50 angry tweets in 2 hours
→ Enriched 10 contacts manually
→ Sent simple outreach email
→ Client closed 2 deals in a week
→ $100K in new revenue

Client's Reaction:
"This is the best ROI we've ever seen.
Can you do this every month?"

My Reaction:
"Holy shit, this actually works"
```

## Month 1: First Paying Clients

### The Cold Email That Started Everything

**Actual Email Sent to 50 CEOs**:
```
Subject: Stealing customers from [Their Biggest Competitor]

Hi [Name],

Weird question - how many customers do you think 
[Competitor] loses each month?

I scraped their reviews and found 200+ angry customers 
in the last 30 days alone. Found emails for 50 of them.

Here are 3 examples:
- [Company 1]: Hates their pricing increase
- [Company 2]: Can't get support responses  
- [Company 3]: Lost data in their outage

Want the full list? I'll send it free to prove this works.

[My name]
P.S. I'm testing a new service and need case studies. 
If it works, we can discuss doing this monthly.
```

**Results**:
```
Sent: 50
Opens: 31 (62%)
Replies: 8 (16% - 26% of opens)
Calls booked: 5
Clients closed: 3
Price point: $3K/month each
MRR: $9,000
```

## Lessons and Recommendations

- Create case studies

Month 3:

```

### The Success Formula

**What Actually Matters**:
```
1. ROI Clarity
"Every dollar spent returns ten"

2. Simple Delivery
"Here are your 50 leads"

3. Consistent Value
"Every. Single. Month."

4. Expectation Management
"We find leads, you close them"

5. Continuous Improvement
"This month was better than last"
```

### Scaling Beyond $20K

**The Path to $50K MRR**:
```

Time to achieve: 3-4 more months
