# Lesson 2.2: Outage Opportunity Monitor

## Title
Outage Opportunity Monitor

## Description
Build a real-time system that detects competitor outages, service disruptions, and performance issues within minutes. Automatically find affected customers and send emergency access offers while the pain is fresh.

## Video Script
"If price increases are gold, outages are platinum. Nothing creates switching urgency like a service being down when customers need it most.

Here's what makes outage monitoring so powerful: it's time-sensitive. When someone tweets 'I can't access my files because [Competitor] is down again,' they're not thinking about switching next quarter. They're thinking about switching right now.

But outages are fast-moving opportunities. The window is usually 2-6 hours from when the outage starts to when it's resolved. Miss that window, and your 'emergency access' offer looks ridiculous.

So we need a monitoring system that's faster than your competitor's status page updates. We're going to monitor their actual service endpoints, their social media mentions, their status pages, AND their customers' complaints in real-time.

The goal is to know about their outage before some of their customers do, and reach out to frustrated users while they're still frustrated.

We'll set up direct service monitoring, social media sentiment tracking, status page monitoring, and even monitor their support queue volume as an early indicator.

This is where timing beats everything else. Let's build your outage opportunity radar."
