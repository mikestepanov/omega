# Lesson 7.2: Partner Ecosystem Infiltration

## Title
Partner Ecosystem Infiltration

## Description
Get listed in competitor integration directories, partner marketplaces, and consultant recommendations. Become the "compatible alternative" that their own partners recommend when customers complain.

## Video Script
"Here's something most people don't realize: your competitor's partners often hate them as much as their customers do. Poor APIs, changing requirements, bad rev-share deals, ignored feature requests. These partners are secretly looking for alternatives to recommend.

Think about it - when a consultant implements your competitor and the client complains about price, who do you think they'll recommend next time? When an integration partner gets shut out by API changes, where do they look? When a reseller's commission gets cut, whose product do they start pushing?

We're going to infiltrate your competitor's entire partner ecosystem. Get listed in the same directories, build better integrations, offer better partner terms, and become the 'insider recommendation' when someone asks for alternatives.

This isn't sneaky - it's strategic positioning. You're providing value to an underserved ecosystem that your competitor takes for granted.

By the end of this lesson, you'll be the alternative that gets recommended by the very people your competitor trusts to grow their business.

Let's turn their partners into your sales force."
