# Lesson 4.1: Clay Enrichment on Steroids

## Title
Clay Enrichment on Steroids

## Description
Maximize Clay's 100 free credits by enriching only the hottest leads first. Chain multiple data sources, build quality scores, and extract personal details that make your outreach irresistible.

## Video Script
"Clay is like having a team of 50 researchers working for you, except it's free for 100 enrichments per month. But here's the thing - most people waste their Clay credits enriching garbage leads that will never convert.

We're going to be surgical with our Clay usage. Think of it like this: you have 100 bullets per month. Do you spray and pray, or do you make each shot count? We're going with option two.

The strategy is simple but powerful. We'll score every lead BEFORE enrichment based on complaint freshness, company fit, and pain indicators. Only the top 100 leads each month get the full Clay treatment. Everyone else gets basic email discovery.

But here's where it gets interesting - we're not just finding emails. We're building complete psychological profiles. Recent job changes, technology stack, personal interests, writing style, peer connections. When you know someone just ran their first marathon AND they're struggling with their CRM, you can craft outreach that feels like it's from a friend, not a salesperson.

Clay's power isn't in the data it finds - it's in the data it connects. One enrichment can trigger 10 data waterfalls that build a complete picture of your prospect.

Let's turn your 100 free credits into 100 perfect shots."
