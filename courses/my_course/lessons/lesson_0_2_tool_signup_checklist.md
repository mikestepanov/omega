# Lesson 0.2: Tool Signup Checklist - The Exact Order That Works

## Overview
Sign up for tools in THIS EXACT ORDER. Some tools work better with others already set up. I've tested this sequence - it minimizes rejections and maximizes free credits.

## Before You Start
- Have your 3 email addresses ready (from Lesson 0.1)
- Have your Google Voice or TextNow number ready
- Open an incognito window for clean signups
- Have your password manager open
- Allow 2-3 hours for all 15 tools

## Signup Tracking Spreadsheet

Create this NOW in Google Sheets:

| Tool | Email Used | Phone Used | Password Hint | Credits | Reset Date | Notes |
|------|------------|------------|---------------|---------|------------|--------|
| Zapier | main@gmail | none | usual+Z | 100 tasks | 1st of month | 5 zaps max |
| Browse.ai | main@gmail | none | usual+B | 50 | 15th | monthly on signup |

## Common Signup Issues & Fixes

**"Email already registered"**
1. Check your password manager first
2. Try password reset to confirm
3. Use a different email variant
4. Last resort: Create new email

**"Invalid phone number"**
1. Tool detected VOIP/TextNow
2. Try Google Voice first
3. Some tools need real mobile
4. Note which tools for future

**"Reaching signup limit"**
1. Too many signups from same IP
2. Switch to mobile data
3. Wait 24 hours
4. Use different browser

**Credit card required but says "free"**
1. Some tools need card for verification
2. Use privacy.com for virtual cards
3. Cancel before trial ends
4. Set calendar reminder

## Time-Saving Tips

1. **Use same password pattern**: YourBase+ToolInitial
2. **Screenshot everything**: Dashboards, credit limits, reset dates
3. **Set calendar reminders**: For credit resets and trial endings
4. **Test immediately**: Send one test through each tool
5. **Document quirks**: Each tool has weird limits not advertised

## Reality Check

**What they promise**: "Unlimited free tier!"
**Reality**: 
- Free tiers are shrinking
- Many require credit cards
- Limits are hit quickly at scale
- Some tools share blacklists

**Monthly reality**:
- Email finding: ~200 emails total across all tools
- Web monitoring: ~10-20 sites effectively  
- Enrichment: ~300 records
- Automation: ~1000 operations

This is enough for testing and small campaigns, not "10k leads per month" fantasies.

## What's Next

Now that you have all tools set up:
1. Lesson 1.1 will show credit optimization strategies
2. Lesson 1.2 provides the master tracking spreadsheet
3. Lesson 1.3 walks through your first test campaign

## Quick Reference Card
