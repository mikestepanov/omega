# Lesson 8.3: Building Your Agency Empire

## Title
Building Your Agency Empire

## Description
Transform your service into a full competitive intelligence agency. Learn hiring, training, quality control, and how to scale to $100K+ MRR while working less than when you started.

## Video Script
"Here's the beautiful irony - you started this to automate competitor hijacking, and now you've created a job for yourself managing clients. But what if I told you that with the right systems, you could scale to $100K+ monthly revenue while working less than you do now?

This isn't about just hiring more people. It's about building a machine that runs without you. We'll cover how to hire A-players for offshore rates, train them to deliver better results than you do, create quality systems that ensure consistency, and build the culture that makes clients stay forever.

I'll show you the exact org chart that supports 50+ clients, the training programs that turn beginners into experts, the dashboards that let you run everything from your phone, and the exit strategies that could make you millions.

By the end of this lesson, you won't have a job - you'll have an empire. One that generates wealth whether you show up or not.

Let's build your agency machine."
