# Lesson 3.1: Social Media Complaint Mining

## Title
Social Media Complaint Mining

## Description
Extract business contacts from Twitter, LinkedIn, and Reddit complaints about competitors. Turn public frustration into private sales conversations with automated profile enrichment and contact discovery.

## Video Script
"Social media is where B2B frustration goes to die - or where smart competitors go to hunt. Every day, business decision-makers publicly complain about their software vendors, and most companies completely ignore this goldmine of sales intelligence.

Here's what makes social media complaint mining so powerful: people tell you exactly what they hate about their current solution, exactly when they're most frustrated, and often exactly who they are and where they work. It's like having access to your competitor's customer satisfaction surveys in real-time.

But there's a skill to mining these complaints effectively. You can't just search for '[Competitor] sucks' and expect quality leads. You need to understand the psychology of B2B social media complaints - when people complain publicly vs privately, how to identify decision-makers vs end users, and how to spot pain that leads to switching vs just venting.

We're going to build a system that finds legitimate business complaints, filters out noise and personal rants, extracts professional contact information, and feeds qualified leads into your outreach pipeline automatically.

The key insight is that most B2B social media complaints happen during business crises - outages, billing issues, support disasters. That's when even conservative executives take their frustration public. That's your moment.

Let's build your complaint mining operation."
