# Lesson 2.1: Price Change Detection System

## Title
Price Change Detection System

## Description
Set up automated monitoring that catches competitor price increases within 24 hours. Configure alerts for pricing pages, press releases, and customer complaints. Build the trigger system that starts your hijack sequence.

## Video Script
"Welcome to Chapter 2, where we start hunting. In Chapter 1, you built the machine. Now we're going to feed it targets.

Price increases are pure gold for competitor customer hijacking. Why? Because angry customers announce themselves. They literally post 'I can't believe [Competitor] raised prices by 40%!' on social media. It's like they're waving a flag saying 'Please steal me as a customer.'

But here's the thing - timing is everything. If you reach out 6 months after a price increase, you look like spam. If you reach out within 24-48 hours, you look like a savior who was paying attention.

The key is building a detection system that catches price changes from three angles: official announcements, website changes, and customer reactions. Most people only monitor one or two of these, which is why they miss 70% of opportunities.

We're going to set up monitoring for pricing pages using Browse.ai, Google Alerts for press releases and blog posts, social media monitoring for customer complaints, and even email monitoring in case competitors announce changes to their customer base first.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have a system that notifies you within hours when any competitor makes a pricing move, and automatically starts enriching the complaints before you even see them.

Let's start hunting."
