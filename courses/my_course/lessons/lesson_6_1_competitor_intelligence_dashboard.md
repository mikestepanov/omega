# Lesson 6.1: Competitor Intelligence Dashboard

## Title
Competitor Intelligence Dashboard

## Description
Build a real-time dashboard tracking competitor health, customer satisfaction, and market vulnerabilities. Spot trends before they become opportunities and position yourself ahead of market shifts.

## Video Script
"Most people react to competitor problems. We're going to predict them. Because by the time a competitor has a public meltdown, it's actually too late - everyone's already fighting over those customers.

The real opportunity is seeing the problems brewing. Support response times gradually increasing. Employee satisfaction dropping. Feature development slowing. Customer complaints shifting from minor to major. These are leading indicators of future opportunities.

Think of this like having a Bloomberg terminal for your competitors' health. You'll track everything from their Glassdoor ratings to their support response times, from their product update frequency to their customer satisfaction trends.

This isn't creepy corporate espionage - it's aggregating public information into actionable intelligence. Every data point we track is publicly available. We're just connecting dots that others miss.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have a dashboard that alerts you to competitor vulnerabilities weeks before they explode into public problems. You'll see price increases coming, predict feature removals, and spot support degradation before customers start complaining.

Let's build your competitive intelligence command center."

```

**Sheet 3: Automated Alerts**
```
Alert Configuration:

```

### Scoring Algorithm

**Competitor Health Score (0-100)**:
```
Components:
Product Stability (30 points):
- Uptime: 15 points (99.9% = 15, 95% = 0)
- Incident rate: 10 points
- Update frequency: 5 points

Customer Satisfaction (40 points):
- Review ratings: 20 points
- Support metrics: 10 points  
- Community health: 10 points

Business Health (30 points):
- Employee satisfaction: 15 points
- Financial stability: 10 points
- Market position: 5 points

Formula:
=ROUND(
  (Uptime_Score * 0.15) +
  (Incident_Score * 0.10) +
  (Update_Score * 0.05) +
  (Review_Score * 0.20) +
  (Support_Score * 0.10) +
  (Community_Score * 0.10) +
  (Employee_Score * 0.15) +
  (Financial_Score * 0.10) +
  (Market_Score * 0.05)
* 100, 0)
```
