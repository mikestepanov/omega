# Lesson 7.1: Competitive Content Hijacking

## Title
Competitive Content Hijacking

## Description
Turn competitor's educational content into your lead generation machine. Create comparison guides, alternative tutorials, and "How to do X without [Competitor]" content that ranks for their brand terms.

## Video Script
"Your competitors spend millions educating the market about problems you both solve. Why not let them do the heavy lifting, then position yourself as the better solution when their educated prospects start looking for alternatives?

This isn't about copying their content. It's about creating strategic counter-content that appears exactly when someone is evaluating or struggling with your competitor. Think of it as intellectual judo - using their marketing momentum against them.

We'll build content that ranks for '[Competitor] alternative', '[Competitor] vs', and 'how to [task] without [Competitor]'. But here's the advanced part - we'll also create content for their specific feature searches, their integration guides, even their error messages.

The psychology is beautiful: someone searching 'how to fix [Competitor] error 403' is already frustrated. Someone reading '[Competitor] pricing guide' is in buying mode. Someone looking for '[Competitor] templates' wants to get work done right now.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have a content strategy that turns every piece of competitor education into a potential customer touchpoint.

Let's hijack their content marketing budget."
