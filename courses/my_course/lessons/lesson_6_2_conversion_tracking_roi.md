# Lesson 6.2: Conversion Tracking & ROI

## Title
Conversion Tracking & ROI

## Description
Measure exactly which competitor campaigns drive revenue. Track customer acquisition costs, lifetime values, and payback periods. Prove the system works with hard data and scale what's profitable.

## Video Script
"Here's what separates amateur competitor hijacking from professional revenue generation: measurement. Most people send emails into the void and hope something good happens. We're going to track every click, every response, every demo, and every dollar.

Why? Because when you can prove that stealing customers from Competitor A costs $200 and generates $5,000 in lifetime value, suddenly you get budget. You get resources. You get to scale.

But tracking competitor campaigns is tricky. The customer journey is complex - they might see your email, research for weeks, then buy through a different channel. We need attribution systems that capture the full story.

We'll build tracking that shows you exactly which competitors are most vulnerable, which pain points convert best, which messages drive revenue, and what your true ROI is on every hour invested.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have CFO-ready dashboards proving that competitor hijacking isn't just clever marketing - it's your most profitable growth channel.

Let's turn your gut feelings into data-driven decisions."

## Tracking Infrastructure Setup

### UTM Parameter Strategy

**Comprehensive Link Tracking**:
```
Base Structure:
utm_source=competitor_[name]
utm_medium=[platform]_[complaint_type]
utm_campaign=[date]_[pain_point]
utm_content=[template_version]
utm_term=[urgency_level]

Examples:
?utm_source=competitor_salesforce
&utm_medium=twitter_outage
&utm_campaign=2024_01_reliability
&utm_content=emergency_template_v2
&utm_term=high_urgency

?utm_source=competitor_hubspot  
&utm_medium=g2_review
&utm_campaign=2024_01_pricing
&utm_content=price_increase_v1
&utm_term=medium_urgency
```

### Multi-Touch Attribution

**Customer Journey Mapping**:
```
Touchpoint Tracking:
1. Initial complaint detected
2. First email sent
3. Email opened
4. Link clicked
5. Website visit
6. Content downloaded
7. Demo requested
8. Sales call held
9. Proposal sent
10. Deal closed

Attribution Models:
- First touch: Initial complaint
- Last touch: Final interaction
- Linear: Equal credit
- Time decay: Recent weighted
- Custom: Pain-point weighted
```
