# Lesson 8.1: Productize Your System

## Title
Productize Your System

## Description
Package your competitor hijacking system into a sellable service. Create tiers, pricing models, and delivery frameworks that scale from $2K to $20K per month per client.

## Video Script
"Plot twist - the system you just built to steal competitor customers? It's worth more as a service than using it yourself. Companies will pay $5,000 to $20,000 per month for you to run this system for them. The math is simple: if you can deliver 10 qualified leads that convert at 10%, that's one new customer worth $50K+ in LTV. Easy ROI.

But here's the key - you can't just say 'I'll steal your competitor's customers.' You need to productize this into a professional service with clear deliverables, proven processes, and predictable results.

We'll build service tiers from basic monitoring to full-service hijacking. You'll learn how to price based on value not hours, how to systematize delivery so you can serve 10+ clients simultaneously, and how to position this as strategic competitive intelligence, not sketchy customer poaching.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have a complete service offering that commands premium prices and delivers exceptional results.

Let's turn your system into a business."
