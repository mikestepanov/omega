# Lesson 2.3: Feature Removal Alerts

## Title
Feature Removal Alerts

## Description
Monitor competitors for deprecated features, sunset announcements, and functionality removals. Catch power users losing their favorite tools and convert them before they find alternatives.

## Video Script
"Feature removals are the gift that keeps on giving. Unlike price increases that affect everyone equally, feature removals create a specific subset of very angry, very vocal power users who feel personally betrayed by their software vendor.

These users are gold because they're not just unhappy - they're evangelists turned enemies. They know the product inside and out, they've probably recommended it to others, and now they feel like the company pulled the rug out from under them.

The psychology is different than price objections. With pricing, people might grumble but often stick around. With feature removal, there's a sense of betrayal. 'I built my workflow around this feature, and now you're telling me it's gone?'

Here's the key insight: competitors usually announce feature removals 30-90 days in advance. That's your window. During those 30-90 days, affected users are actively looking for alternatives, posting in forums, asking for recommendations.

We're going to monitor product roadmaps, changelog pages, support documentation updates, beta testing forums, and user community discussions. We want to know about feature deprecation before the users do, so we can be ready with a solution when they start complaining.

The strategy is simple: find the features being killed, find the users who depend on those features, and show them how your product handles those use cases better.

Let's build your feature removal early warning system."

## Feature Removal Detection Strategy

### Four-Source Monitoring Approach

- Help article updates
- Feature flag changes
- Migration guides published
- FAQ updates about discontinuation

**Source 3: User Community Signals** (1-30 days advance notice)
- Forum discussions about missing features
- Beta tester complaints
- Support ticket patterns
- User feedback surveys

**Source 4: User Reactions** (Real-time after announcement)
- Social media complaints
- Review site updates
- Forum evacuation discussions
- Alternative software searches
