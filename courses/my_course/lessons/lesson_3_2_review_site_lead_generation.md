# Lesson 3.2: Review Site Lead Generation

## Title
Review Site Lead Generation

## Description
Transform 1-star reviews on G2, Capterra, and Trustpilot into qualified leads. Extract reviewer identities, enrich business contacts, and reach out while the pain is fresh with personalized solutions.

## Video Script
"Review sites are where B2B buyers go to vent after the honeymoon period ends. Unlike social media complaints that are often heat-of-the-moment reactions, reviews represent considered, detailed feedback from actual users who've invested time and money into a solution.

Here's why review site mining is so powerful: reviewers literally tell you their name, their company, what features they use, what's broken, and what would make them switch. It's like having a detailed RFP from every unhappy customer of your competitors.

The psychology is different too. When someone takes the time to write a detailed 1 or 2-star review, they're not just venting - they're warning their peers. They've mentally moved past frustration into active evaluation mode. These aren't prospects; they're buyers who've already proven they'll pay for solutions in your category.

But there's an art to mining reviews effectively. You need to distinguish between legitimate business pain and unreasonable expectations, identify the decision-makers behind the reviews, and reach out in a way that acknowledges their specific experience without seeming predatory.

We're going to build a system that monitors new negative reviews daily, extracts reviewer business context, enriches contact information, and delivers personalized outreach that positions you as the solution to their specific documented pain points.

The conversion rates here are exceptional because you're not guessing about their problems - they've written them out in detail for you.

Let's turn their bad reviews into your good leads."

Hi [Name],

I came across your detailed review of [Competitor] on [Platform], particularly your point about [specific complaint]. Your experience with [specific issue] mirrors what we heard from [Customer Name] before they switched to us.

We built [Your Product] specifically to address [mentioned pain point]. For example, [specific solution to their complaint].

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how we handle [their specific use case] differently?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Feature Gap Response Template**:
```
Subject: The [specific feature] [Competitor] couldn't deliver

Hi [Name],

Your review about missing [feature] in [Competitor] caught my attention. It's actually one of the main reasons [similar company] switched to our platform last quarter.

We've built [feature] to work exactly the way you described needing it - [specific functionality]. Plus, unlike [Competitor], we don't charge extra for [related feature].

I'd love to show you how [Customer] uses this feature to [achieve specific outcome]. Worth a quick look?
```

Hi [Name],

Your [Competitor] implementation experience sounds painfully familiar. Taking [timeframe] to get basic functionality working is exactly why we built our 2-week implementation guarantee.

[Similar Customer] was in the same situation - [implementation issue] with [Competitor]. They were fully operational with us in 12 days, including data migration.

Happy to share their implementation playbook if you're still evaluating options.
