# Lesson 2.4: Support Disaster Monitoring

## Title
Support Disaster Monitoring

## Description
Track competitor customer support failures, response time disasters, and service quality meltdowns. Find frustrated customers during their worst support experiences and offer superior alternatives.

## Video Script
"Bad customer support is the most personal type of competitor failure. When someone's been waiting 48 hours for a response to an urgent issue, they're not just frustrated with the product - they feel ignored, disrespected, and undervalued as a customer.

Support disasters create the most emotional switching decisions. Price increases are logical. Outages are temporary. Feature removals affect workflows. But bad support? That's personal. It makes customers feel like their business doesn't matter.

Here's what makes support disaster monitoring so effective: customers broadcast their frustration publicly. They tweet at companies, post in forums, leave scathing reviews, and ask for alternatives in public channels. They're literally asking to be rescued.

The timing window is different than other opportunities. Support frustration builds over time - first ticket ignored, second follow-up delayed, third escalation mishandled. By the time they post publicly, they're already mentally shopping for alternatives.

We're going to monitor support response times, customer satisfaction scores, public complaints, review sentiment, and even competitor hiring patterns that indicate support team problems.

The goal is to find customers at their peak frustration moment and offer them the support experience they should have received from their current vendor.

Let's build your support disaster radar."
