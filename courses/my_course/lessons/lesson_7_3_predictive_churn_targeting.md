# Lesson 7.3: Predictive Churn Targeting

## Title
Predictive Churn Targeting

## Description
Identify competitor customers likely to churn before they start complaining. Use financial data, usage patterns, and market signals to reach out with perfect timing - right before they start looking for alternatives.

## Video Script
"What if you could predict which competitor customers will churn 3-6 months before they actually leave? Not through magic, but through patterns that repeat over and over across every SaaS company.

Here's the thing - customers don't just wake up one day and decide to switch. There's a predictable journey: initial excitement, reality sets in, specific frustrations build, they start researching alternatives, then finally make the switch. Most competitor hijacking waits until step 4. We're going to catch them at step 2.

We'll use public signals like hiring freezes, leadership changes, funding issues, and industry shifts. We'll layer in usage patterns we can observe externally - support ticket volume, community activity, feature requests. Then we'll build a scoring system that identifies pre-churn customers with scary accuracy.

This isn't creepy - it's strategic. You're reaching out to help before they even know they need it.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have a system that identifies future churners 90-120 days before they start their alternative search.

Let's predict the future."

## Churn Signal Framework

- New VP Sales (tool evaluation)
- New CMO (martech audit)
- Founder departure (strategy shift)
- Board changes (new priorities)

Business Model Shifts:
- Pivot announced (needs change)
- Market focus change (tool mismatch)
- M&A activity (consolidation)
- Geographic expansion (new requirements)
- Downsizing (overbuilt stack)
```

### Usage Pattern Recognition

**Observable Behavior Changes**:
```
Support Indicators:

```

## Predictive Scoring Model

### Multi-Factor Churn Score

**Weighted Scoring System**:
```
High-Risk Factors (3 points each):
- Recent layoffs
- CFO/CTO change
- Funding issues
- Public complaints
- Champion departed

Medium-Risk Factors (2 points each):
- Hiring freeze
- Industry downturn
- Feature requests ignored
- Support complaints
- Competition adopted

Low-Risk Factors (1 point each):
- Market changes
- Usage stagnation  
- Price sensitivity mentioned
- Contract renewal approaching
- New competitor entered

Score Interpretation:
0-3: Monitor monthly
4-7: Monitor weekly
8-11: Outreach opportunity
12+: Urgent intervention
```

### Timing Optimization

**Outreach Sweet Spots**:
```
Renewal Timeline:
- 6 months out: Too early (unless high score)
- 4 months out: Evaluation beginning
- 3 months out: Perfect timing
- 2 months out: Active shopping
- 1 month out: Often too late

Fiscal Calendar:
- Q4: Budget planning (October outreach)
- Q1: New budget available
- Post-funding: Efficiency focus
- Pre-board meeting: Preparation scramble
```
