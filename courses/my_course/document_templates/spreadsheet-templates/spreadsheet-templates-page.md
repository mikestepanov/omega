# Essential Spreadsheet Templates Bundle

## What You'll Get
A complete collection of 10 interconnected spreadsheet templates that cover everything from financial planning to hiring tracking. These templates have helped hundreds of startups manage growth from $0 to $10M ARR without expensive software.

## Video Script

**[00:00-00:15] Hook**
"You're drowning in data but flying blind on decisions. I'll show you the exact 10 spreadsheets that transform chaos into clarity and help you run your startup like a pro - all without expensive tools or consultants."

**[00:15-00:35] Context**
"These aren't random templates - they're a interconnected system refined by hundreds of startups. Each spreadsheet feeds into the others, creating a single source of truth for your business. From tracking burn rate to planning hiring to measuring product metrics, this bundle covers everything you need from founding to Series A."

**[00:35-01:05] The Financial Foundation**
"Start with three core financial sheets: Cash flow forecast, P&L tracker, and budget vs actual. These connect to show past, present, and future money. Cash flow tells you when you'll die, P&L shows if you're building a real business, budget vs actual keeps you honest. Update weekly, review monthly, and you'll never be surprised by your bank balance again."

**[01:05-01:35] The Metrics Dashboard**
"Next, your KPI dashboard tracks what matters: MRR, churn, CAC, LTV, and burn multiple. Connect this to your CRM exports. Use conditional formatting - red for danger, yellow for warning, green for good. Include 13-week trends for pattern recognition. This one sheet replaces expensive analytics tools and gives you talking points for every investor meeting."

**[01:35-02:05] The Operations Tracker**
"Three operational sheets keep execution tight: Hiring pipeline tracks candidates through stages. Product roadmap shows features by quarter with resource allocation. Sales pipeline forecasts revenue with probability weighting. These sheets talk to each other - hiring plan reflects roadmap needs, sales forecast feeds cash flow. It's operational intelligence in spreadsheet form."

**[02:05-02:30] The Planning Tools**
"Round out with planning templates: Scenario planner models different growth paths. Cap table tracks ownership through rounds. Market sizing validates TAM claims. OKR tracker aligns team efforts. These aren't daily sheets but quarterly strategic tools. They force clear thinking and prevent expensive mistakes."

**[02:30-02:55] Integration and Automation**
"The magic is integration. Sales pipeline feeds revenue in cash flow. Hiring plan feeds expenses in P&L. KPIs trigger scenario planning updates. Use IMPORTRANGE to connect sheets, VLOOKUP for data consistency, and conditional formatting for alerts. Spend a day setting up, save hundreds of hours firefighting."

**[02:55-03:15] Best Practices**
"Three rules for spreadsheet success: Version control everything - duplicate before major changes. Document assumptions clearly - future you will forget. Review regularly - weekly for operational, monthly for financial, quarterly for strategic. These sheets are living documents, not set-and-forget files."

**[03:15-03:30] Call to Action**
"Download all 10 templates now and start with the cash flow forecast - it's the most immediately valuable. Set up one sheet per day over the next two weeks. By day 10, you'll have complete operational visibility. Stop flying blind - start managing by numbers."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **The Over-Engineer**
Building NASA-level complexity. Keep it simple enough for anyone to update.

### 2. **The Set-and-Forget**
Creating templates but never updating. Stale data is worse than no data.

### 3. **The Silo Builder**
Not connecting related sheets. Integration is where insights live.

### 4. **The Assumption Hider**
Not documenting why you chose certain numbers. Future you needs context.

### 5. **The Manual Updater**
Not using formulas and connections. Automate everything possible.

### 6. **The Access Anarchist**
Letting everyone edit everything. Use view-only and comment permissions.

Use data validation to prevent errors. Dropdowns > free text.

### 3. **The Change Log**
Keep a tab documenting major changes and why. Invaluable for debugging.

### 4. **The Dashboard Tab**
First tab of each sheet should be executive summary. Details in subsequent tabs.

### 5. **The Mobile Check**
Ensure critical sheets are readable on phone. You'll check during anxious moments.

### 6. **The Board Package**
Create PDF snapshot monthly. Version control for board meetings.
