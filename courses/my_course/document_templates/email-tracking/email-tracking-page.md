# Email Tracking & Follow-up Template

## What You'll Get
A systematic approach to email tracking and follow-ups that ensures no opportunity falls through the cracks. This template helps founders and sales teams increase response rates by 3x through perfectly timed, personalized follow-ups.

## Video Script

**[00:00-00:15] Hook**
"You know that investor who never replied? That customer who went dark? That partnership that fizzled out? They didn't say no - you just stopped following up. I'll show you a system that gets responses from 75% of cold emails through strategic persistence."

**[00:15-00:30] Context**
"Most people send one email and give up. But studies show it takes an average of 7 touches to get a response, and the 6th email often has the highest response rate. This template gives you a systematic way to track every important email and follow up at the perfect intervals without being annoying."

**[00:30-00:55] The Tracking System**
"First, categorize your emails: Critical (investors, big customers), Important (partnerships, hiring), and Standard (general outreach). Each category gets different follow-up intensity. Critical emails get 7 touches over 3 weeks. Important gets 5 over 2 weeks. Standard gets 3 over 1 week. Track opens, clicks, and responses. No opens after 3 attempts? Your subject line sucks. Opens but no clicks? Your ask isn't clear."

**[00:55-01:25] The Follow-up Sequence**
"Here's the magic sequence: Day 1 original email. Day 3 quick bump - 'Float this to the top.' Day 7 add value - share relevant article or insight. Day 11 reframe - approach from different angle. Day 16 break up - 'Should I close the loop?' This isn't pestering - it's persistence. Each email should be shorter than the last. By email 5, it's two sentences max."

**[01:25-01:50] The Value-Add Method**
"Never follow up empty-handed. Email 2: 'Saw you expanded to Austin - congrats!' Email 3: 'Your competitor just did X, thought you should know.' Email 4: 'Just heard [mutual connection] mention you.' Add value, show you're paying attention. Generic bumps get ignored. Personalized bumps get responses."

**[01:50-02:15] Tools and Automation**
"Use email tracking tools like Mixmax or Hubspot to see opens and clicks. Set up sequences in your CRM. But don't over-automate - personalization beats automation. Create templates for follow-up types but customize each send. The goal is systematic persistence, not robotic spam."

**[02:15-02:35] Response Handling**
"When they respond, act fast. 50% of deals go to whoever responds first. Have templates ready: interested response, not right time, wrong person. Always end with a clear next step. 'Let's chat Tuesday at 2pm PT' beats 'Let me know when you're free.' Assume the sale and make it easy to say yes."

**[02:35-02:55] Common Mistakes**
"Three follow-up killers: Giving up after one email - rookie mistake. Following up same day - looks desperate. Sending novels - if they didn't read email one, they won't read your essay. Keep it short, add value, and be pleasantly persistent."

**[02:55-03:08] Call to Action**
"Download this template and set up your tracking system today. Then go to your sent folder, find 10 important emails with no response, and send follow-up number two right now. You'll get at least 3 responses by tomorrow, guaranteed."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **The One-and-Done**
Sending one email and giving up. 80% of sales require 5+ touches.

### 2. **The Pest**
Following up daily or multiple times per day. Respect their time.

### 3. **The Robot**
Using identical follow-ups. Each should add new value.

### 4. **The Novelist**
Writing longer emails each time. Get progressively shorter.

### 5. **The Ghost**
Disappearing after they respond. Fast response time wins deals.

### 6. **The Apologizer**
Starting with "Sorry to bother you." Be confident in your value.

## Success Metrics

### Activity Metrics:
- **Open rate**: 40%+ for cold, 60%+ for warm
- **Click rate**: 10%+ on CTAs
- **Response rate**: 20%+ after full sequence
- **Positive response**: 25%+ of total responses

### Business Outcomes:
- **Meeting book rate**: 10%+ of sequences
- **Pipeline generated**: Track value of responded opportunities
- **Time to response**: Under 4 touches average
- **Sequence completion**: 80%+ get full follow-up

### Optimization Indicators:

## Pro Tips

### 1. **The Pattern Interrupt**
Send follow-up at odd times (6:47 AM). Stands out in inbox.

### 2. **The Subject Line Test**
Change subject line on follow-up 3. Sometimes breaks through.

### 3. **The Channel Switch**
After email 4, try LinkedIn or Twitter. Different medium, same message.

### 4. **The Video Follow-up**
Record 30-second Loom video for follow-up 3. 3x response rate.

### 5. **The Assistant CC**
CC their assistant on follow-up 5. Often gets through.

### 6. **The Forward Effect**
Forward your original email with "Thoughts?" Feels less salesy.
