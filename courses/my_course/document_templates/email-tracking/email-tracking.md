# Email Tracking & Follow-up Scheduler

## Video Talking Script

"Here's the brutal truth about competitor customer hijacking: sending the first email is only 20% of the work. The other 80% is in the follow-up sequence. Most people send one email, get no response, and give up. Meanwhile, your competitors are following up 3, 4, 5 times and closing deals you could have won.

This Email Tracking & Follow-up Scheduler ensures you never let a hot lead go cold just because they didn't respond to your first email. Because here's what you need to understand: when someone's favorite tool just had an outage or price increase, they're not sitting around waiting for your email. They're dealing with the crisis, fielding angry customer calls, or scrambling to find solutions.

Your perfectly timed, perfectly personalized email might arrive at the exact moment they're in a meeting with their CEO explaining why their productivity tool just went down. They see it, think 'I'll respond to this later,' and then never think about it again.

This template solves that by creating a systematic follow-up sequence that feels helpful, not pushy. Instead of 'Did you see my email?' you'll send value-driven follow-ups that reference new developments, share relevant case studies, or offer additional resources.

The template has four main sections: Initial Send Tracking, Follow-up Sequence Planning, Response Management, and Performance Analytics.

In Initial Send Tracking, you'll log every email you send with key details like the competitor trigger, personalization used, and expected response timeframe. This prevents you from losing track of who you've contacted and when.

Follow-up Sequence Planning maps out your next 3-4 touchpoints based on the type of opportunity. A price increase follow-up sequence looks different from an outage follow-up sequence because the psychology and timing are different.

Response Management helps you categorize and prioritize responses. Someone who says 'This looks interesting, can we talk next week?' gets different treatment than someone who says 'Send me more information.'

Performance Analytics tracks what's working so you can double down on successful approaches and eliminate what's not working.

The magic is in the systematization. Instead of hoping you remember to follow up, you'll have a clear schedule and proven templates for each touchpoint. This transforms random outreach into a predictable lead generation machine.

Let's set up your tracking system!"
