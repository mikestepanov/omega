# Zapier Automation Templates for Startups

## What You'll Get
A collection of 15 essential Zapier automation templates specifically designed for resource-constrained startups. These pre-built workflows automate repetitive tasks across sales, marketing, operations, and customer success - no coding required.

## Video Script

**[00:00-00:15] Hook**
"You're wasting 15 hours every week on tasks a robot should do - copying data, sending follow-ups, updating spreadsheets. I'll show you exactly how to automate these soul-crushing tasks with Zapier templates you can set up in minutes, not months."

**[00:15-00:35] Context**
"Zapier connects 5,000+ apps without code, but most founders don't know where to start. These 15 templates are the highest-ROI automations based on data from hundreds of startups. Each saves 1-3 hours weekly. Implement all 15 and you've just hired a virtual assistant who never sleeps, never complains, and costs less than lunch."

**[00:35-01:05] Sales Automations**
"First, automate your sales pipeline. Template 1: New leads from forms straight to CRM with enrichment. Template 2: Slack notification when deals hit certain stages. Template 3: Automatic follow-up sequences based on lead score. Template 4: Calendar bookings create CRM activities. Template 5: Lost deals trigger feedback surveys. These five automations give you enterprise sales ops without the enterprise budget."

**[01:05-01:35] Marketing Automations**
"Marketing runs on autopilot with these. Template 6: Social media posts from content calendar. Template 7: New blog posts trigger email newsletters. Template 8: Webinar registrants added to nurture campaigns. Template 9: Review monitoring triggers response workflows. Template 10: Lead scoring based on engagement. Stop being a manual marketing machine - let Zapier handle the repetitive stuff."

**[01:35-02:05] Operations Automations**
"Operations automations are pure time savings. Template 11: Invoices from Stripe create accounting records. Template 12: New hires trigger onboarding checklist. Template 13: Support tickets route based on keywords. Template 14: Meeting notes sync to project management. Template 15: Weekly reports compile automatically. Each automation removes a Friday afternoon task from your plate."

**[02:05-02:30] Setup Strategy**
"Don't automate everything at once - you'll break things. Start with one painful, repetitive task. Build, test with 10 records, then scale. Use filters to handle edge cases. Add error handling for when things fail. Document what each Zap does - future you will thank present you. Review monthly and prune what's not providing value."

**[02:30-02:55] ROI Calculation**
"Let's do the math. 15 automations saving 90 minutes each weekly equals 22.5 hours. At $50/hour, that's $1,125 weekly or $58,500 annually. Zapier costs $49/month. That's 100x ROI ignoring the errors prevented and response time improvements. This isn't a cost - it's the best hire you'll make this year."

**[02:55-03:10] Common Pitfalls**
"Three automation killers: Over-automating edge cases - if it happens once a month, do it manually. Not testing thoroughly - always run 10 test records. Forgetting the human touch - some things shouldn't be automated. Automate the robot work, not the relationship work."

**[03:10-03:25] Call to Action**
"Download these 15 templates now. Pick your most painful repetitive task and implement that automation today - not someday. Set a timer for 30 minutes. By the time it rings, you'll have your first Zap running. Next week, add another. In 15 weeks, you'll wonder how you ever lived without automation."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **The Complexity Creep**
Starting with 20-step Zaps. Begin simple, add complexity later.

### 2. **The Set-and-Forget**
Not monitoring for failures. Automations break when apps update.

### 3. **The Over-Automator**
Automating human touches. Keep personal interactions personal.

### 4. **The Format Forgetter**
Not handling data formatting. Dates and numbers cause most failures.

### 5. **The Documentation Skipper**
Not documenting workflows. You'll forget what that Zap does in 3 months.

### 6. **The Test Skipper**
Going live without thorough testing. Test with 10+ records first.

## Success Metrics

## Pro Tips

Use Paths for IF/THEN logic. One Zap can handle multiple scenarios.

Zapier's Formatter is free and powerful. Master it for data manipulation.

### 3. **The Delay Tactic**
Use Delay steps for human-like timing. Don't spam instantly.

### 4. **The Lookup Table**
Store reference data in Zapier Tables for dynamic workflows.

### 5. **The Error Handler**
Add error handling paths. When (not if) things fail, have a backup plan.

### 6. **The Version Control**
Copy Zaps before major changes. Easy rollback saves headaches.
