# ROI Calculator & Business Case Template

## What You'll Get
A customizable ROI calculator template that transforms vague value propositions into concrete dollar amounts. This tool has helped startups close 40% more enterprise deals by speaking the language CFOs understand: money saved and earned.

## Video Script

**[00:00-00:15] Hook**
"Your enterprise prospect just said 'It's too expensive.' But it's not - they just can't see the ROI. I'll show you how to build calculators that prove your product pays for itself in 3 months and generates 400% ROI in year one."

**[00:15-00:30] Context**
"Enterprise buyers need to justify every purchase with a business case. Hope isn't a strategy - math is. This ROI calculator template has helped startups turn 'maybe next quarter' into 'where do I sign?' by quantifying value in their prospect's exact situation. No more generic case studies - personalized business cases."

**[00:30-01:00] The Three ROI Components**
"Every ROI calculator needs three sections: Cost savings, revenue gains, and investment required. Cost savings include time saved, errors reduced, tools replaced. Revenue gains cover faster sales cycles, higher conversion rates, new opportunities. Investment includes your price plus implementation time. The magic is making it specific to their business - use their salary costs, their conversion rates, their volumes."

**[01:00-01:30] Building Credible Assumptions**
"Garbage in, garbage out. Source every assumption. Time saved? Run actual tests. Error rates? Use industry benchmarks. Salary costs? Use their location and level. Build in sensitivity analysis - what if you only deliver 50% of promised value? Still ROI positive? Good. Include conservative, expected, and optimistic scenarios. Let them choose which to believe."

**[01:30-02:00] The Visualization Layer**
"Numbers in rows don't sell - visualizations do. Show payback period on a timeline. Graph cumulative savings over 3 years. Use their logo and brand colors. Create executive summary with three numbers: Total savings, ROI percentage, and payback months. Make it boardroom-ready. One page they can screenshot and share."

**[02:00-02:25] Collaborative Selling**
"Don't build the calculator alone - build it with your champion. 'What's your team's average hourly cost?' 'How many errors per month?' This isn't an interrogation - it's collaborative value discovery. They'll trust numbers they helped create. End with: 'Did we miss any value areas?' Often they'll add benefits you didn't consider."

**[02:25-02:45] Common Pitfalls**
"Three calculator killers: Over-promising with ridiculous ROI - anything over 300% year one looks fake. Ignoring soft costs like training time. And using generic industry averages instead of their specific numbers. Be conservative and specific. Under-promise the calculator, over-deliver with the product."

**[02:45-03:05] Implementation**
"Build your template in Google Sheets for easy sharing and collaboration. Create customer-specific copies they can edit. Include clear instructions and tooltips. Add your champion's name as co-author - it's their business case too. Update quarterly as you get better data."

**[03:05-03:20] Call to Action**
"Download this template and build your first ROI calculator today. Start with your most common use case. Test it with your last lost deal - would quantified ROI have changed the outcome? Then use it on your next enterprise opportunity. Watch 'too expensive' transform into 'how fast can we implement?'"
