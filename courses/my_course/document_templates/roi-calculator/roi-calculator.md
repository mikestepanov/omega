# ROI Calculator & Business Case Builder

## Video Talking Script

"One of the biggest mistakes I see people make with competitor customer hijacking is treating it like a nice-to-have marketing experiment. They send a few emails, maybe get some responses, but they never actually measure whether this whole system is worth their time and effort.

Here's the thing: competitor customer hijacking can be the highest ROI activity your business does, but only if you track it properly and build compelling business cases for the prospects you're targeting.

This ROI Calculator & Business Case Builder serves two critical purposes. First, it proves to YOU that this strategy is working and worth scaling up. Second, it helps you build bulletproof business cases for prospects who are on the fence about switching from competitors.

Let me break down why both sides matter. On your internal ROI side, you need to know exactly how much time you're spending on this system, how much it's costing you, and how much revenue it's generating. Because if you're spending 10 hours a week to generate one $500 customer, that's probably not worth it. But if you're spending 2 hours a week to generate three $5,000 customers, now we're talking about something you should double down on.

On the prospect business case side, people don't switch tools just because they're frustrated. They switch when they can clearly see that staying with their current solution is costing them more than switching. Your job is to make that math crystal clear.

The calculator has four main sections: Internal ROI Tracking, Prospect Cost Analysis, Switching Benefits Quantification, and Business Case Presentation.

Internal ROI Tracking measures everything on your side - time invested, tools costs, opportunity costs, and revenue generated. This tells you whether to scale up, optimize, or pivot your approach.

Prospect Cost Analysis helps you calculate exactly what their current competitor problems are costing them. Is that outage costing them $1,000 per hour in lost productivity? Is that price increase adding $50,000 to their annual budget? Get specific.

Switching Benefits Quantification shows the measurable upside of moving to your solution. Not just features, but actual dollars saved, hours recovered, or risks eliminated.

Business Case Presentation pulls it all together into a compelling narrative that makes switching feel like the obvious financial decision.

The best part? Once you build a solid business case for one prospect, you can adapt it for similar companies facing the same competitor issues. This becomes a repeatable sales asset, not just a one-time analysis.

Let's build your ROI tracking system and create your first bulletproof business case!"
