# Cash Flow Forecast Template

## What You'll Get
A comprehensive cash flow tracking system that shows exactly when you'll run out of money and what to do about it. This template has helped founders extend runway by an average of 3 months through better cash management.

## Video Script

**[00:00-00:15] Hook**
"82% of startups fail because they run out of cash, not because they build bad products. I'm going to show you the exact cash flow template that helps founders sleep at night by always knowing their runway down to the day."

**[00:15-00:35] Context**
"This isn't another complex financial model. This is a survival tool. I've seen founders discover they had 2 weeks of cash left when they thought they had 2 months. This template prevents that nightmare. It takes 45 minutes to set up and 15 minutes weekly to maintain. That time investment will literally save your company."

**[00:35-01:00] Summary Dashboard**
"Start with your dashboard - current cash, burn rate, and runway in months. Use our color coding: red for under 3 months, yellow for 3-6, green for over 6. This isn't arbitrary - under 6 months means start fundraising NOW. The dashboard should be screenshot and shared with co-founders weekly. No surprises allowed."

**[01:00-01:30] Monthly Projections**
"The monthly view shows starting cash, money in, money out, and ending cash for each month. Here's the key: be pessimistic on revenue and realistic on costs. That customer who 'definitely' will pay next month? Assume they won't. That hire starting next month? Include their full cost from day 1. Better to be pleasantly surprised than suddenly broke."

**[01:30-02:00] Cash Inflows**
"Break down revenue by type - recurring, one-time, services. Include collection delays. If customers pay net-30, that means cash arrives in month 2, not month 1. Add other inflows like funding rounds, but only when wire transfers are confirmed. 'Soft commits' don't pay bills. Include grants and tax refunds only when certain."

**[02:00-02:30] Cash Outflows**
"List every expense category. Salaries are usually 60-70% for early startups. Don't forget payroll taxes - they're ~15% on top. Include benefits, contractors, rent, software, marketing, legal fees. Pro tip: Export your credit card statement and categorize everything. Founders always underestimate by 20-30%."

**[02:30-02:55] Scenario Planning**
"This section saves companies. Model three scenarios: base, bear, and bull. Bear case: what if revenue drops 30%? What if your biggest customer churns? Bull case: what if that enterprise deal closes? Knowing your runway in each scenario lets you act fast when reality shifts."

**[02:55-03:15] Action Triggers**
"The template includes specific actions for each runway scenario. Under 3 months? Cut everything non-essential TODAY. Under 6 months? Start fundraising immediately. Over 9 months? You can invest in growth. These aren't suggestions - they're survival rules."

**[03:15-03:35] Call to Action**
"Download this template now and spend the next 45 minutes filling it out. I guarantee you'll discover at least one surprise about your cash position. Update it every Monday morning - make it a founder ritual. The companies that survive are the ones that respect cash flow. Don't learn this lesson the hard way."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **The Optimist's Curse**
Projecting revenue based on hopes, not contracts. That "sure thing" deal has a 50% chance of happening and will take 2x longer than promised.

### 2. **The Hidden Costs**
Forgetting employer taxes (15%), benefits (10%), and equipment for new hires. A $100K salary costs $130-140K all-in.

### 3. **The Collection Fantasy**
Assuming customers pay on time. Build in 45-60 day collection cycles for enterprise, 30 days for SMB.

### 4. **The One-Time Windfall**
Planning based on that big one-time deal. Recurring revenue is what keeps you alive.

### 5. **The Set-and-Forget**
Creating the forecast once and never updating. This is a living document - update weekly or it's worthless.

### 6. **The Growth Hallucination**
Projecting 50% month-over-month growth forever. Even hot startups plateau - model it.

## Success Metrics

### Health Indicators:
- **Runway:** Maintain 9+ months (green zone)
- **Burn Multiple:** Revenue growth ÷ burn rate > 1.5
- **Collection Time:** Under 45 days average
- **Forecast Accuracy:** Within 10% of actuals

### Process Metrics:
- **Update Frequency:** Weekly without fail
- **Surprise Expenses:** Less than 5% of budget
- **Cash Cushion:** 2 months expenses minimum

### Action Metrics:
- **Fundraise Start:** At 6 months runway
- **Cost Cuts:** Implemented within 1 week of trigger
- **Collection Follow-ups:** Same day when overdue

## Pro Tips

### 1. **The Monday Morning Ritual**
Block 30 minutes every Monday at 8am for cash updates. No exceptions. Make it sacred.

### 2. **The Double Buffer**
Whatever runway you calculate, assume 70% in reality. Things always take longer and cost more.

### 3. **The Payment Stack**
When cash tight, pay in this order: Payroll → Rent → Critical vendors → Everything else.

### 4. **The Revenue Recognition Reality**
Booked revenue ≠ Cash received. Only count cash when it hits your bank.

### 5. **The Vendor Negotiation**
When under 3 months runway, call every vendor. Most will extend payment terms to keep your business.

### 6. **The Board Update**
Send cash flow snapshot before every board meeting. Prevents awkward "How much runway?" questions.
