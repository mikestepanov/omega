# Competitor Monitoring Checklist

## Video Talking Script

"Hey there! Welcome to the Competitor Monitoring Checklist document template. This is probably the most important document you'll use in this entire system, because without proper monitoring, you'll miss 90% of the opportunities to hijack your competitors' unhappy customers.

Let me walk you through exactly how to use this checklist to set up your monitoring system in the next 30 minutes.

First, why do you need this? Most businesses are reactive - they find out about competitor price increases or outages days or weeks later, when the opportunity has already passed. By the time you hear about Unity's pricing disaster on Twitter, thousands of other companies have already reached out to those angry developers. You need to be first.

This checklist has three sections: Setup, Daily Monitoring, and Trigger Actions.

In the Setup section, you'll configure all your alerts once. This takes about 20 minutes upfront but saves you hours every week. You'll set up Google Alerts for competitor pricing changes, RSS feeds for their status pages, and social media monitoring for complaint keywords.

The Daily Monitoring section is your 5-minute morning routine. Just like checking your email, you'll quickly scan for any opportunities that fired overnight. Most days there won't be anything, but when there is, you'll be the first to know.

The Trigger Actions section tells you exactly what to do when you spot an opportunity. No more wondering 'Should I reach out?' or 'What should I say?' The checklist tells you which email template to use and how quickly to respond.

The best part? Once you set this up, it runs on autopilot. You'll start seeing competitor customer hijack opportunities flowing into your inbox automatically.

Download the checklist below, follow the setup instructions, and you'll have a 24/7 competitor intelligence system running by tomorrow morning. Let's get started!"

## Title
Competitor Monitoring Checklist

## Description

**What It Does:**
A systematic checklist for setting up automated monitoring of your competitors' customer pain points. This document walks you through creating a 24/7 early warning system that alerts you within hours of competitor price increases, outages, feature removals, and support failures.

**When to Use:**
Use this checklist during your initial system setup (Week 1) and revisit quarterly to add new competitors or refine your monitoring. Essential for any business wanting to systematically capture competitor defections rather than stumbling across them randomly.

**How It Helps:**
Transforms you from reactive (hearing about opportunities days later) to proactive (first to reach out while customers are actively frustrated). Reduces manual research time from hours to minutes per day while dramatically increasing the quantity and quality of leads you capture.
