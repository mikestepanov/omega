# Competitor Monitoring Checklist Template

## What You'll Get
A systematic checklist for monitoring competitors that ensures you never get blindsided by competitive moves. This weekly 30-minute process has helped startups spot threats early and capitalize on competitor mistakes.

## Video Script

**[00:00-00:15] Hook**
"Imagine your biggest competitor just raised $50M, launched your exact feature, and hired your VP of Sales - and you find out from a customer. I'll show you a 30-minute weekly process that ensures you're never surprised by competitors again."

**[00:15-00:30] Context**
"Most founders check competitors randomly when they're anxious. This reactive approach means you miss opportunities and get blindsided by threats. This systematic checklist takes 30 minutes weekly and covers everything from product updates to hiring moves. Companies using it spot competitive threats 3-4 weeks earlier on average."

**[00:30-00:55] The Six Monitoring Categories**
"Effective monitoring covers six areas: Product changes, pricing moves, marketing campaigns, team changes, customer sentiment, and strategic shifts. Set up alerts and dashboards for each. Don't just track what they did - analyze why. A price drop might signal cash flow issues. A CMO hire might predict a rebrand. Connect the dots."

**[00:55-01:25] Product and Pricing Intelligence**
"For product monitoring, track their changelog, API docs, and support forums. Customers complain about missing features - that's your opportunity. For pricing, use tools like Wayback Machine to spot changes. Document not just new prices but packaging changes. When they bundle features, they're moving upmarket. When they unbundle, they're struggling."

**[01:25-01:55] Marketing and Messaging**
"Monitor their ad spend with Facebook Ad Library and Google Ads Transparency. Rising spend means funding or traction. Track their content themes - a shift from 'easy' to 'enterprise' messaging signals repositioning. Set Google Alerts for their brand plus keywords like 'funding', 'lawsuit', 'acquisition'. Their PR reveals strategy if you read between lines."

**[01:55-02:20] Team and Customer Intelligence**
"LinkedIn Sales Navigator shows all employee changes. New enterprise sales hires mean they're moving upmarket. Engineering hiring surges predict feature launches in 3-6 months. For customers, monitor review sites weekly. New complaints reveal product gaps. Lost customers often vent publicly - reach out to win them."

**[02:20-02:45] Analysis and Action**
"Intelligence without action is worthless. For each finding, document three things: What changed, why it matters, and how you'll respond. Share a weekly competitive brief with your team. Include win opportunities - maybe they deprecated a feature your customers love. Speed wins - act on intelligence within 48 hours."

**[02:45-03:00] Tools and Automation**
"Automate what you can: Google Alerts for brand mentions, LinkedIn notifications for company updates, Visualping for website changes, Ahrefs for SEO tracking. But human analysis is crucial. Tools gather data - you spot patterns and opportunities."

**[03:00-03:15] Call to Action**
"Download this checklist and spend 30 minutes right now doing your first competitive scan. You'll find at least one surprise, guaranteed. Then block 30 minutes every Monday morning for monitoring. Consistent intelligence gathering is a superpower - start building yours today."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **The Information Hoarder**
Collecting data without analyzing or acting. Intelligence is only valuable when used.

### 2. **The Obsessive Monitor**
Checking competitors hourly. It's a distraction - weekly is sufficient for most.

### 3. **The Single Source**
Only monitoring their website. The real intelligence is in forums, reviews, and employee moves.

### 4. **The Echo Chamber**
Only tracking direct competitors. Category expansion threats come from adjacents.

### 5. **The Silent Analyst**
Not sharing findings with the team. Everyone needs competitive context.

### 6. **The Copycat**
Copying every competitor move. Monitor to understand, not to mimic.
