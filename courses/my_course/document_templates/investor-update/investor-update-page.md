# Investor Update Template

## What You'll Get
A professional investor update template that helps you communicate progress, challenges, and needs in the format investors expect. Regular updates lead to more introductions, better advice, and faster follow-on funding.

## Video Script

**[00:00-00:15] Hook**
"If you're not sending monthly investor updates, you're leaving money and connections on the table. I'm going to show you how to write investor updates that actually get responses and help grow your business - all in just 15 minutes per month."

**[00:15-00:30] Context**
"This template has helped founders raise follow-on funding 40% faster and get 3x more strategic introductions. The best part? Investors actually want these updates - you're not bothering them, you're keeping them engaged in your success."

**[00:30-01:00] Metrics Section**
"Start with your metrics dashboard. Include 5-7 key numbers: MRR, customer count, burn rate, and runway are mandatory. Then add 1-2 metrics specific to your business. Always show month-over-month changes - investors want to see trends, not just snapshots. Pro tip: If a metric is down, acknowledge it - investors appreciate transparency."

**[01:00-01:30] Highlights Section**
"Next, share 2-3 specific wins. Don't just say 'sales are good' - say 'closed 3 enterprise deals worth $45K ARR including Fortune 500 company X.' Be specific with numbers and names when possible. This is where you build momentum and excitement."

**[01:30-02:00] Challenges Section**
"Here's where most founders mess up - they hide problems. Don't. Share 1-2 real challenges you're facing. Maybe your sales cycle is longer than expected or hiring is tough. Then immediately follow with what you're doing about it. This builds trust and often triggers helpful responses."

**[02:00-02:30] Asks Section**
"The asks section is pure gold. Make 1-3 specific requests. Not 'let me know if you can help' but 'I need an intro to the CMO at Stripe for a partnership discussion.' The more specific your ask, the more likely you'll get help. One founder got 12 introductions from a single update using this approach."

**[02:30-02:45] What's Next Section**
"Briefly outline your 30-60 day priorities. Keep it to 3 bullet points max. This shows you're focused and helps investors understand where you're headed."

**[02:45-03:00] Best Practices**
"Three rules for success: Send updates monthly even when things are tough, keep it under 500 words, and always include specific asks. Set a recurring calendar reminder for the first Monday of each month."

**[03:00-03:12] Call to Action**
"Download the template now and send your first update today. The sooner you start, the sooner you'll see the compound benefits of keeping investors engaged. Your future self will thank you!"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **The Ghost Founder**
Only sending updates when raising money. This damages relationships and makes fundraising harder.

### 2. **The Novel Writer**
Writing 2,000-word essays. Investors are busy - respect their time with concise updates.

### 3. **The Vague Asker**
"Let me know if you can help with anything." Be specific or don't ask at all.

### 4. **The Eternal Optimist**
Never sharing challenges. Investors know startups are hard - your credibility depends on balanced updates.

### 5. **The Data Hider**
Not including specific metrics. Numbers build trust and show you're on top of your business.

## Success Metrics

Track these to ensure your updates are working:

- **Open Rate:** Target 50%+ (investor updates typically see 60-80%)
- **Response Rate:** Target 20%+ (shows engagement)
- **Asks Fulfilled:** Track how many requests get addressed
- **Time to Response:** Good updates get replies within 48 hours
- **Introduction Quality:** Are intros leading to real opportunities?

## Pro Tips

1. **Send on Tuesday mornings** for highest open rates
2. **Use a consistent subject line** like "[Company] Investor Update - Month Year"
3. **Include a one-line TL;DR** at the very top for scanners
4. **Forward great customer feedback** as social proof
5. **Thank investors who help** in the next update

## Founder Examples

**Sarah, B2B SaaS Founder:**
"I was hesitant to share that our runway was down to 4 months. But being transparent led to 3 investors offering bridge funding and 5 customer introductions that extended our runway to 12 months."

**Marcus, Marketplace Founder:**
"My specific ask for a data scientist hire got me 8 candidate referrals. We hired one who became our CTO. That single ask in a monthly update changed our company trajectory."
