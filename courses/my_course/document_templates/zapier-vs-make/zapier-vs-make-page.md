# Zapier vs Make (Integromat) Comparison Guide

## What You'll Get
A comprehensive comparison guide that helps you choose between Zapier and Make (formerly Integromat) for your startup's automation needs. Includes decision framework, cost analysis, and migration strategies to ensure you pick the right tool.

## Video Script

**[00:00-00:15] Hook**
"Choosing the wrong automation platform is like building on quicksand - painful to migrate and expensive to scale. I'll show you exactly when to use Zapier versus Make, potentially saving you thousands in fees and hundreds of hours in migration pain."

**[00:15-00:35] Context**
"Zapier and Make both connect apps without code, but they're fundamentally different beasts. Zapier is the friendly golden retriever - easy to train, works with everyone. Make is the border collie - incredibly capable but needs an experienced handler. Your choice impacts cost, complexity, and capabilities for years. Let's make sure you choose right."

**[00:35-01:05] Zapier Strengths**
"Zapier wins on simplicity and app coverage. 5,000+ integrations versus Make's 1,500. Interface so simple your intern can build automations. Pricing is per task - predictable but can get expensive. Best for straightforward workflows: when this happens, do that. Perfect for sales and marketing automations where simplicity beats complexity. Think of it as automation training wheels that actually scale."

**[01:05-01:35] Make Strengths**
"Make wins on power and pricing. Visual workflow builder shows your entire automation. Handles complex logic, loops, and error handling that makes Zapier cry. Pricing by operations not tasks - often 10x cheaper at scale. Data transformation tools are incredible. HTTP module connects anything. BUT - steeper learning curve. You'll spend a week learning what takes an hour in Zapier."

**[01:35-02:00] Decision Framework**
"Choose Zapier if: You need 5+ app integrations, value speed over cost, have non-technical team members building automations, need enterprise support. Choose Make if: You have complex multi-step workflows, process high volumes, have technical team members, need advanced error handling. The $20K/year Zapier bill often equals $2K in Make."

**[02:00-02:25] Cost Comparison**
"Real example: 50,000 tasks monthly. Zapier: $599/month. Make: $59/month for same volume. But add training time - Zapier saves 20 hours upfront. Break-even is around 10,000 monthly tasks. Below that, Zapier's simplicity wins. Above that, Make's pricing wins. Factor in your team's hourly rate when calculating true cost."

**[02:25-02:45] Migration Strategy**
"Start with Zapier for speed, migrate to Make when you hit 10K+ monthly tasks. Or use both - Zapier for simple marketing automations, Make for complex operations workflows. Document everything - screenshots, logic, test cases. Migration takes 2-3 hours per complex workflow. Don't migrate working automations unless ROI is clear."

**[02:45-03:00] Common Mistakes**
"Three costly mistakes: Choosing based on features not actual needs - most use 20% of capabilities. Not factoring in team training time. Starting with Make when Zapier would work - premature optimization kills. Pick based on next 12 months, not next 12 years."

**[03:00-03:18] Call to Action**
"Download the comparison matrix and calculate your monthly task volume. If under 2,000 tasks, start with Zapier today. Over 10,000, invest the week learning Make. In between? Try both with real workflows. Your future self will thank you for choosing correctly now versus migrating later."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **The Premature Optimizer**
Choosing Make before you need it. Complexity has a cost.

### 2. **The Price-Only Decision**
Ignoring team training and maintenance time. TCO includes human hours.

### 3. **The All-or-Nothing**
Migrating everything at once. Use both tools for different purposes.

### 4. **The Documentation Skipper**
Not documenting workflows before migration. You'll rebuild from scratch.

### 5. **The Solo Decision**
Not involving the team who'll use it daily. Adoption matters more than features.

### 6. **The Feature FOMO**
Choosing based on features you'll never use. Pick for actual needs.

## Success Metrics

### Platform Performance:
- **Automation uptime**: >99.9%
- **Error rate**: <1%
- **Processing speed**: <2 seconds
- **Support response**: <4 hours

### Business Impact:
- **Time saved**: Track hours automated
- **Cost per automation**: Total cost/workflows
- **Team adoption**: Active builders
- **ROI achieved**: Time saved Ã— rate

## Pro Tips

### 1. **The Hybrid Approach**
Use Zapier for marketing, Make for operations. Best of both worlds.

### 2. **The Sandbox Method**
Always test in separate environment first. Production breaks are painful.

### 3. **The Documentation First**
Document before building. Clear logic prevents platform lock-in.

### 4. **The Annual Negotiation**
Both platforms negotiate on annual plans. 20-30% discounts possible.

### 5. **The Community Gold**
Make's community shares complex scenarios free. Worth joining.

**Sarah, E-commerce:**
"We use both - Zapier for Shopify integrations (better app), Make for order processing (complex logic). Don't force one tool for everything."

**Marcus, Agency:**
"Tried starting with Make to save money. Team couldn't figure it out. Switched to Zapier, built 50 automations in a month. Sometimes simple wins."
