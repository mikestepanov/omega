# Zapier vs Make (Integromat) - Which One for Your Automation?

## Quick Decision Guide

**Use Zapier if:**
- You're new to automation
- You need simple 2-3 step workflows
- You want extensive app library (5,000+ apps)
- You prefer ease over complexity
- Budget isn't tight (gets expensive at scale)

**Use Make if:**
- You need complex branching logic
- You're processing lots of data (10x more operations for same price)
- You want visual workflow builder
- You need advanced features (routers, aggregators, iterators)
- You're comfortable with slight learning curve

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Simple Email Finder
**Task**: New lead in sheet → Find email → Update sheet

**Zapier Setup** (3 tasks used):
```
1. Trigger: New row in Google Sheets (1 task)
2. Action: Hunter.io email finder (1 task)  
3. Action: Update Google Sheets (1 task)
Total: 3 tasks per lead
Monthly capacity: 33 leads
```

**Make Setup** (3 operations used):
```
1. Watch rows in Google Sheets (1 operation)
2. Hunter.io email finder (1 operation)
3. Update Google Sheets (1 operation)
Total: 3 operations per lead
Monthly capacity: 333 leads
```

### Example 2: Complex Email Waterfall
**Task**: Try 3 email finders, stop when found, update sheet

**Zapier Setup** (harder to build):
```
- Needs multiple Zaps or complex paths
- Can't truly "stop" when email found
- Uses 4-8 tasks whether needed or not
- Requires paid plan for paths
```

**Make Setup** (built for this):
```
1. Watch new rows
2. Router: Check if email exists
3. Branch 1: Try Clearbit
   - If found → Update sheet → Stop
4. Branch 2: Try Hunter
   - If found → Update sheet → Stop
5. Branch 3: Try Snov
   - Update sheet with result
Total: Only uses operations for tools actually called
```

## Feature Comparison

### Make Exclusive Features
- **Data Store**: Built-in database (huge deal!)
- **Aggregators**: Combine multiple items

- **Error Handling**: Detailed error routes
- **JSON/API**: Much better handling
- **Webhooks**: More sophisticated options

### Zapier Exclusive Features

## Migration Strategy

### Start with Zapier When:
1. Testing if automation works for your use case
2. You need dead-simple setup
3. Specific app only on Zapier
4. Team isn't technical

### Move to Make When:
1. Hitting Zapier's task limits
2. Need complex logic
3. Want to save money
4. Ready for more power

### Run Both (Pro Move):
- Use Zapier for simple, stable automations
- Use Make for complex, high-volume workflows
- Connect them via webhooks
- Total free operations: 1,100/month

## Workflow Examples in Each

### Browse.ai Price Monitor

**Zapier Version:**
```
Browse.ai (webhook) → Filter (>10% change) → Google Sheets → Gmail
Simple, linear, works fine
```

**Make Version:**
```
Browse.ai (webhook) → Router:
  Path 1 (>20% increase): Urgent Slack + Email + Sheet
  Path 2 (10-20%): Regular email + Sheet
  Path 3 (<10%): Just log to sheet
  Path 4 (Decrease): Opportunity alert
More sophisticated responses
```

### Multi-Tool Email Finder

**Zapier:**
```
Need multiple Zaps or expensive plan for conditional logic
Each tool checked wastes tasks
No good way to aggregate results
```

**Make:**
```
One scenario with router:
- Check cache first (Data Store)
- Try tools in order
- Stop when found
- Cache result
- Update sheet once
5x more efficient
```

2. Time: 10 minutes to build (bit more complex)
3. Test with 50 records (more operations available)
4. Add router for "email not found" path

## Pro Tips

1. **Free Tier Hack**: Use both! 100 Zapier tasks + 1,000 Make operations
2. **Learning Curve**: Make takes 2-3 hours to grasp vs 30 minutes for Zapier
3. **Debug Mode**: Make's is far superior for troubleshooting
4. **Mobile Apps**: Zapier's is better for monitoring on-the-go
5. **Community**: Both have active communities, Make's is more technical

## The Bottom Line

**For this course**: Start with Zapier for initial testing (easier). When you hit limits or need complex logic, graduate to Make. The 10x operation advantage makes Make the winner for scaling, but Zapier's simplicity wins for getting started fast.

**My recommendation**: Learn both. Use Zapier free tier for simple stuff, Make for everything else. Total investment: 3 hours learning. Total savings: $480+/year.
