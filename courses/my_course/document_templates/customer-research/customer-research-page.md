# Customer Research Template

## What You'll Get
A proven customer research framework that helps you uncover real customer needs, not just what they say they want. This template has helped founders avoid building features nobody uses and discover opportunities worth millions.

## Video Script

**[00:00-00:15] Hook**
"The number one reason startups fail isn't competition or funding - it's building something nobody wants. I'll show you the exact customer research process that helps you discover what people will actually pay for, not just what they say sounds cool."

**[00:15-00:35] Context**
"This template is based on the 'Mom Test' principles and has been refined across hundreds of customer interviews. The difference between good and bad customer research is worth months of development time and hundreds of thousands in wasted resources. Most founders ask leading questions and hear what they want. This framework forces you to discover truth."

**[00:35-01:00] The Three-Part Structure**
"Great customer research has three phases: Context, Problem, and Solution - in that order. Start with their current workflow and pain points. Dig into specific problems with real examples. Only then explore solutions. Most founders jump straight to 'Would you use this?' That's worthless. Instead, ask 'Tell me about the last time you dealt with this problem.'"

**[01:00-01:30] The Context Phase**
"Begin with their current reality: 'Walk me through how you handle X today.' Listen for workarounds, spreadsheets, and complaints. Ask 'What's the hardest part about that?' followed by 'Why is that hard?' five times. Document exact words - 'annoying' and 'impossible' mean very different things. Time their workflow. If it takes 5 minutes, a 3-minute solution isn't worth switching."

**[01:30-02:00] The Problem Phase**
"Now dig into specific problems. 'Tell me about the last time X went wrong' reveals more than 'What's your biggest challenge?' Get stories, not opinions. Ask for consequences: 'What happened because of that?' and 'How much did that cost you?' If they can't remember a specific incident or consequence, it's not a real problem."

**[02:00-02:30] The Solution Exploration**
"Only after understanding their world do you explore solutions. Don't pitch your idea. Instead ask: 'If you had a magic wand, how would this work?' Then probe feasibility: 'What would stop you from switching to something new?' Listen for budget, authority, and switching costs. End with: 'Who else should I talk to about this?' Good problems are worth referrals."

**[02:30-02:55] Analysis and Synthesis**
"After 5-10 interviews, patterns emerge. Look for repeated exact phrases - that's marketing copy. Stack rank problems by frequency times severity times willingness to pay. One severe problem affecting everyone beats ten minor annoyances. Document quotes verbatim - you'll reference them for months."

**[02:55-03:10] Common Pitfalls**
"Three research killers: Leading questions like 'Wouldn't it be great if...', talking more than listening - aim for 80/20 them/you, and recruiting wrong customers - current users tell you incremental improvements, non-users reveal new markets."

**[03:10-03:24] Call to Action**
"Download this template and schedule 5 customer interviews this week. Not next month - this week. Use the exact script provided. After interview three, you'll start seeing patterns. After five, you'll know exactly what to build. Stop guessing what customers want - go find out."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **The Pitch Disguise**
Pretending to research while actually selling. Customers smell it and tell you what you want to hear.

### 2. **The Henry Ford**
Asking what features they want. They'll say "faster horse" not "car". Focus on problems, not solutions.

### 3. **The Confirmation Seeker**
Only interviewing people likely to agree. Talk to skeptics and non-users too.

### 4. **The Surface Skimmer**
Accepting first answers. The truth comes after "why" number three or four.

### 5. **The Memory Truster**
Not recording interviews. You'll forget 80% and misremember the rest.

### 6. **The Solo Researcher**
Doing all interviews yourself. Different team members notice different things.

## Pro Tips

### 1. **The Awkward Silence**
After they answer, count to three before speaking. They'll fill silence with truth.

### 2. **The Screen Share**
For B2B, have them share their screen and show you. Seeing beats hearing.

### 3. **The Diary Study**
Ask them to document the problem for a week. Real-time beats memory.

### 4. **The Buddy System**
Interview with a partner. One leads, one observes body language and follows up.

### 5. **The Competition Question**
"What would happen if you did nothing?" reveals true urgency.

### 6. **The Magic Wand**
"Budget aside, describe the perfect solution" reveals ideal state.

## Founder Examples

**Alex, Analytics Platform:**
"We almost built real-time dashboards because everyone said they wanted them. Research revealed they check data weekly. We built scheduled reports instead and grew to $5M ARR."

**Maria, EdTech:**
"Customer research killed our first idea in week 2. Painful but saved us 6 months. The interviews revealed a adjacent problem we hadn't considered - now worth $10M."

**Dev, Logistics SaaS:**
"One customer said 'I wake up at 3am worried about late shipments.' That quote became our homepage headline and resonated with everyone."
