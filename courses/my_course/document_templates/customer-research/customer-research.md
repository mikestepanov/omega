# Customer Research Template

## Video Talking Script

"Alright, so you've spotted an opportunity - maybe Unity just announced a price increase, or Slack is having an outage. Your monitoring system worked perfectly. But now you're staring at a blank email screen thinking 'Who exactly should I email, and what should I say to them specifically?'

This is where most people fail. They send generic blast emails to random people and wonder why no one responds. The Customer Research Template solves this by turning you into a detective who finds the exact right people and learns their specific pain points before you ever hit send.

Here's how this works: You'll use this template to research individual prospects in about 3-5 minutes per person. The goal isn't to become a stalker - it's to find 2-3 specific details that let you personalize your outreach and show you actually understand their situation.

The template has four sections: Target Identification, Pain Point Research, Personalization Intel, and Outreach Timing.

In Target Identification, you'll find people who are actually affected by the competitor issue. Not just anyone who uses that tool, but people who are actively complaining, asking for alternatives, or expressing frustration. We're looking for warm leads, not cold prospects.

Pain Point Research is where you dig into their specific problems. Are they blocked from launching a product? Losing customers? Bleeding money? The more specific you can get, the more your email will resonate.

Personalization Intel helps you find common ground - maybe you went to the same university, worked at similar companies, or face the same challenges. This isn't about manipulation, it's about building genuine connection.

Outreach Timing tells you exactly when to reach out based on how fresh their pain is. Someone who posted an angry tweet 2 hours ago needs different timing than someone who wrote a blog post last month.

The magic happens when you combine all four sections. Instead of sending a generic 'Hey, try our tool' email, you'll send something like 'Hey Sarah, saw your tweet about Unity's new fees blocking your indie game launch. We've helped 50+ game developers migrate off Unity without losing their progress. Want to see how we solved this exact issue for Indie Studio X?'

See the difference? Same email template, but now it's laser-targeted to their specific situation.

Use this template every time you spot an opportunity. Spend 15-20 minutes researching 5-7 prospects, then send personalized emails that actually get responses. Let's dive in!"

Customer Research Template

## Description

**What It Does:**
A systematic research framework for identifying and qualifying high-value prospects during competitor crises. This template guides you through a 3-5 minute research process per prospect to gather specific pain points, personalization details, and optimal outreach timing.

**When to Use:**
Use immediately after detecting a competitor opportunity but before sending any emails. Essential for transforming generic outreach into highly personalized messages that reference specific situations and pain points.

**How It Helps:**
Increases email response rates from 2-5% (generic blasts) to 15-30% (personalized research-based outreach). Helps you focus on prospects most likely to convert rather than wasting time on people who aren't actually affected by the competitor issue.
