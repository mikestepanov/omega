# Fundraising Pitch Deck Template

## What You'll Get
A proven 10-slide pitch deck template based on successful raises from YC, Techstars, and 500 Startups companies. Each slide is optimized for investor psychology with clear instructions on what works and what doesn't.

## Video Script

**[00:00-00:15] Hook**
"Most pitch decks fail in the first 30 seconds. I'm going to show you the exact 10-slide template that helped founders raise over $50M, including what investors look for on each slide and the mistakes that kill deals."

**[00:15-00:30] Context**
"This template is based on analyzing 200+ successful pitch decks and direct feedback from VCs at Sequoia, a16z, and First Round. The average founder using this template gets 3x more investor meetings and raises 40% faster than those who wing it."

**[00:30-00:50] Title & Problem Slides**
"Start with a clean title slide - company name, tagline, and contact info. No clutter. Slide 2 is your problem slide. This is where most founders fail. Don't describe the problem - make investors FEEL it. Use specific numbers: '73% of retailers lose $8K monthly to inventory waste' beats 'inventory management is hard.' Include visuals that show the pain."

**[00:50-01:15] Solution & Market Slides**
"Your solution slide must show, not tell. Include a screenshot or simple diagram. Explain your solution in 3 steps max - connect, analyze, profit. For market size, investors want to see TAM, SAM, and SOM. Show your math. A bottom-up calculation beats random analyst reports. Include market growth trends that create urgency."

**[01:15-01:40] Business Model & Traction**
"Business model is simple: how you charge, how much, and your unit economics. Show CAC, LTV, and payback period. Investors can spot made-up numbers, so be realistic. For traction, revenue growth trumps vanity metrics. Show MRR growth, retention rates, and real customer logos. Even 5 paying customers beats '10,000 signups.'"

**[01:40-02:05] Competition & Team**
"Never say you have no competition - it shows naivety. Create a simple comparison table highlighting your unique advantages. Position yourself as different, not just better. For team, investors bet on people. Show domain expertise and past execution. 'Previously sold a company' beats 'passionate about the space.'"

**[02:05-02:25] The Ask & Vision**
"Be specific with your ask. '$2M seed round, $500K committed' is perfect. Break down use of funds into product, sales, and team. Show what milestones this funding achieves. End with vision - paint a picture of the world with your solution at scale. Make investors imagine the IPO."

**[02:25-02:40] Design Tips**
"Keep it visual - aim for 30 words max per slide. Use consistent fonts and colors. Include one key message per slide. Practice the 3-second test: can someone understand each slide in 3 seconds? If not, simplify. Remember, this deck gets you the meeting - it doesn't close the deal."

**[02:40-02:55] Common Mistakes**
"Top mistakes: Too much text, no story flow, unclear ask, missing traction data, and weak team slide. Also, never use NDAs, don't hide your revenue, and please spell check. One typo can kill credibility. Test your deck on advisor before sending to investors."

**[02:55-03:10] Best Practices**
"Send as PDF, not PowerPoint. Include clickable appendix links for deep dives. Follow up within 48 hours. Track opens and time spent per slide - tools like DocSend help. Most importantly, customize slides 1 and 9 for each investor based on their portfolio."

**[03:10-03:28] Call to Action**
"Download the template now and start with slides 2 and 6 - nail your problem and traction first. Everything else builds from there. This deck structure has helped founders go from idea to funded in 60 days. Your story deserves to be heard - now you have the framework to tell it."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **The Novel Deck**
20+ slides with walls of text. Investors spend 3 minutes per deck - respect their time.

### 2. **The Humble Brag**
"Conservative" projections showing $1B revenue in year 3. Be ambitious but credible.

### 3. **The Feature Laundry List**
Focusing on features instead of customer value. Investors buy outcomes, not features.

### 4. **The Weak Ask**
"We're raising $1-5M" shows you don't know what you need. Be specific.

### 5. **The Missing Metrics**
"We're growing fast!" without numbers. Always include specific metrics.

### 6. **The Solo Founder**
Not showing team or advisors. Startups are team sports - show your bench.

### 7. **The Jargon Jungle**
Technical terms and acronyms. Your mom should understand your deck.

## Pro Tips

### 1. **The Forwardable Test**
Would an investor forward this to a partner? Make it easy with clear value prop.

### 2. **The Airplane Test**
Print your deck - does it work without you presenting? It should.

### 3. **The Mom Test**
Can your non-technical relative understand it? Simplify until yes.

### 4. **The Screenshot Strategy**
Include product screenshots on solutions slide - seeing is believing.

### 5. **The Metrics Hierarchy**
Revenue > Customers > Users > Signups > Website visits

### 6. **The Story Arc**
Problem → Solution → Traction → Vision. Everything else supports this narrative.

## Founder Examples

**Alex, SaaS Founder:**

**Maria, Marketplace Founder:**
"The competition slide framework was game-changing. Instead of saying we're better, we showed how we're different. Three investors mentioned it was the clearest positioning they'd seen."

**James, D2C Founder:**
"Starting with the problem slide transformed our pitch. We went from explaining features to showing a $50B problem. Investors finally 'got it' and we oversubscribed our round."
