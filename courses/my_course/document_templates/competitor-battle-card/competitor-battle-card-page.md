# Competitor Battle Card Template

## What You'll Get
A one-page competitive battle card template that arms your sales team with exactly what they need to win deals against specific competitors. Used by sales teams at high-growth startups to improve win rates by 25-40%.

## Video Script

**[00:00-00:15] Hook**
"Your sales team is losing deals to competitors because they're scrambling for answers during calls. I'll show you how to create battle cards that turn your team into competitive ninjas who close deals with confidence."

**[00:15-00:30] Context**
"This template distills hours of competitive research into one page your sales team will actually reference. Companies using structured battle cards see 25-40% higher win rates against documented competitors. The key is making them scannable, accurate, and updated monthly."

**[00:30-01:00] Structure Overview**
"A great battle card has five sections: Quick positioning to frame the conversation, their strengths so you don't look ignorant, their weaknesses to exploit, landmines to avoid, and discovery questions that tilt the field. Keep each section to 3-5 bullets max. Your sales team has 30 seconds to scan this during a call - make every word count."

**[01:00-01:30] Positioning and Messaging**
"Start with one sentence positioning: 'If they say X, we say Y.' For example: 'If they say they're cheaper, we say: You're right, they are 20% cheaper because they lack enterprise security features that prevent million-dollar breaches.' Give your team exact words, not concepts. Include 3 proof points with specific customer names and results."

**[01:30-02:00] Strengths and Weaknesses**
"List their real strengths - denying obvious advantages kills credibility. But frame them: 'They're great for simple use cases, but when you need X, they fall short.' For weaknesses, focus on structural limitations they can't easily fix, not bugs. Include recent customer churns with reasons if you have them. This isn't gossip - it's intelligence."

**[02:00-02:30] Landmines and Questions**
"Landmines are topics to avoid - maybe they just raised $50M or hired your former CTO. Don't let sales reps get ambushed. For discovery questions, give 5 questions that expose their weaknesses naturally: 'How important is GDPR compliance?' knowing they're not compliant. 'What's your monthly data volume?' knowing they throttle at your prospect's size."

**[02:30-02:50] Maintenance and Distribution**
"Battle cards die from neglect. Assign one owner per competitor, update monthly, and track which cards get used. Store them in your CRM where reps can access during calls. Pro tip: Record role-plays using each battle card - showing beats telling. And celebrate wins where battle cards made the difference."

**[02:50-03:10] Common Mistakes**
"Three battle card killers: First, making them too long - if it's over one page, it won't get used. Second, being too fair - this is competitive intelligence, not a product review. Third, not including talk tracks - concepts don't help in live conversations, exact phrases do."

**[03:10-03:22] Call to Action**
"Download the template and create your first battle card for your biggest competitor today. Share it with one sales rep and listen to their next competitive call. You'll immediately hear the difference. Great battle cards are living documents - start simple and improve with each lost deal analysis."

## When to Use This Template

### Create Battle Cards When:
- You lose 2+ deals to the same competitor
- A new competitor enters your space
- Sales reps report confusion during competitive situations
- Win rates drop below 40% in competitive deals

### Update Battle Cards When:
- Competitors launch new features or pricing
- You win/lose a significant deal against them
- Their positioning or messaging changes
- Monthly as standard practice

### Priority Order:
1. Competitor taking most deals (highest threat)
2. Competitor in most deals (highest frequency)
3. New entrant with momentum (future threat)
4. Legacy vendor being displaced (opportunity)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Gather Intelligence (2 hours)
- Review last 10 win/loss reports against this competitor
- Study their website, pricing, and recent announcements
- Interview 2-3 reps who've competed against them
- Check G2/Capterra reviews for patterns
- Mystery shop their demo if possible

### 2. Interview Your Champions (30 minutes)
- Call 2-3 customers who chose you over them
- Ask: "What almost made you choose [competitor]?"
- Ask: "What ultimately tipped the scales?"
- Document exact phrases they use

### 3. Build Positioning (30 minutes)
- Write their position in 10 words
- Write your counter-position in 10 words
- Create 3 "If they say X, we say Y" talk tracks
- Add 3 specific proof points with metrics

### 4. Document Strengths/Weaknesses (30 minutes)
- List 3-5 genuine strengths (builds credibility)
- List 5-7 exploitable weaknesses
- Focus on structural issues, not temporary ones
- Include evidence (customer quotes, review themes)

### 5. Create Discovery Questions (15 minutes)
- Write 5 questions that expose their gaps
- Make questions consultative, not aggressive
- Include follow-up probes for each
- Test with your best sales rep

### 6. Format and Distribute (15 minutes)
- Keep to one page maximum
- Use bullets, not paragraphs
- Bold key phrases for scanning
- Upload to CRM and sales tools
- Schedule monthly review reminder

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **The Encyclopedia**
Creating 5-page detailed comparisons. Sales reps need snackable intelligence, not research papers.

### 2. **The Trash Talk**
Bashing competitors openly. Buyers hate it and it backfires every time.

### 3. **The Set-and-Forget**
Creating once and never updating. Stale battle cards are worse than none.

### 4. **The Feature List**
Comparing feature checkboxes. Focus on business outcomes and use cases instead.

### 5. **The Internal Secret**
Not sharing with the whole team. Everyone from SDR to CS needs competitive intelligence.

### 6. **The Ignorance Card**
Underestimating competitors. Respect their strengths to beat them effectively.

## Success Metrics

### Usage Metrics:
- **Access rate**: 80%+ of reps viewing monthly
- **Call usage**: Referenced in 50%+ of competitive deals
- **Update frequency**: Refreshed monthly minimum
- **Rep feedback**: 4+ out of 5 usefulness rating

### Business Metrics:
- **Win rate improvement**: +25-40% vs documented competitors
- **Deal velocity**: 20% faster close in competitive deals
- **Price protection**: 10% less discounting required
- **Rep confidence**: Measured via survey

### Leading Indicators:

- Competitive mentions in won deal notes
- Decreased "lost to competitor" without details
- Increased competitive displacement wins

## Pro Tips

### 1. **The Customer Quote Bank**
Keep a file of exact customer quotes about competitors. Nothing beats "Your customer John at Acme told us..."

### 2. **The Win/Loss Pattern**
Track which messages work by competitor. Your Enterprise battle card differs from SMB.

### 3. **The Competitor Slack Channel**
Create a channel for real-time competitive intel. Crowdsource from your entire team.

### 4. **The Role-Play Requirement**
Don't release a battle card until reps practice it. Knowing and doing are different.

### 5. **The Pricing Intelligence**
Include their discounting patterns. "They typically drop 30% in Q4" helps negotiations.

### 6. **The Partnership Play**
Document their integration gaps. Often the easiest differentiation.
