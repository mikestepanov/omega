# Competitor Battle Card

## Video Talking Script

"Alright, so you've been hijacking competitor customers left and right, but then you get on a sales call and the prospect says 'Well, how do you compare to [Competitor X]?' And you freeze up. You start rambling about features, or worse, you bad-mouth the competitor and sound unprofessional.

This is where the Competitor Battle Card becomes your secret weapon. Think of it as your cheat sheet for any conversation where competitors come up. But here's the key - this isn't about trashing the competition. It's about positioning yourself strategically based on their specific weaknesses and your unique strengths.

The battle card has five critical sections that prepare you for any competitive conversation.

First, the Positioning Framework shows you how to frame the conversation before features even come up. Instead of fighting on their turf, you redirect to areas where you naturally win.

Second, the Strengths vs Weaknesses Matrix gives you the factual ammunition you need. But notice - we focus on their business model problems, not personal attacks. 'Their pricing model penalizes growth' hits harder than 'their software sucks.'

Third, the Objection Response Library prepares you for the five most common pushbacks you'll hear. These aren't just responses - they're conversation redirectors that flip objections into selling opportunities.

Fourth, the Proof Points section arms you with specific examples, metrics, and case studies that back up every claim you make. Numbers beat opinions every time.

Finally, the Conversation Flow gives you the exact sequence to handle competitive discussions professionally and persuasively.

Here's what makes this different from typical sales battle cards: we're not trying to win feature wars. We're positioning based on the fundamental problems that drive customers away from competitors in the first place. Remember, these prospects are already frustrated with their current solution - your job is to show them a better path forward, not convince them their current choice was stupid.

Use this battle card before every sales call, and customize it as you learn what really resonates with prospects. Let's build your competitive advantage!"
