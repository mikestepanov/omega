# Advisor Agreement Template

## What You'll Get
A comprehensive advisor agreement template that balances protecting your equity while attracting top-tier advisors. This template has been used by hundreds of startups to formalize relationships with advisors from Google, Facebook, and successful founders.

## Video Script

**[00:00-00:15] Hook**
"Great advisors can 10x your startup's trajectory, but a bad advisor agreement can cost you 1% of your company for nothing in return. I'll show you exactly how to structure advisor relationships that create real value without giving away the farm."

**[00:15-00:30] Context**
"This template is based on standard Silicon Valley terms that have worked for companies from pre-seed to IPO. The average startup works with 3-5 advisors, and the difference between good and bad agreements can be worth millions at exit. Let's make sure you get it right from day one."

**[00:30-01:00] Services Section**
"Start with crystal clear expectations. Define the specific expertise area - don't just say 'business advice.' Say 'B2B SaaS go-to-market strategy' or 'enterprise sales to Fortune 500.' Set time commitment at 2-4 hours monthly - anything more is a consultant, not an advisor. List 2-3 specific deliverables like quarterly strategy reviews or intro targets. Vague agreements lead to disappointed founders and inactive advisors."

**[01:00-01:30] Compensation Structure**
"Here's the equity math: Standard advisors get 0.10-0.25%, high-value advisors 0.25-0.50%, and board-level advisors up to 1%. Always use 2-year monthly vesting with a 3-month cliff. This protects you if they ghost after signing. Pro tip: Include single trigger acceleration of 25-50% on acquisition - it incentivizes advisors to help you exit successfully."

**[01:30-02:00] IP and Confidentiality**
"Two critical protections: First, all work product becomes company property - you don't want advisors claiming they own your pivot idea. Second, confidentiality survives termination by 3-5 years minimum. Include publicity rights so you can announce the relationship, but require approval for specifics. This prevents advisors from over-promising their involvement."

**[02:00-02:30] Term and Termination**
"Set a 2-year initial term - long enough to vest fully, short enough to part ways if needed. Either party can terminate with 30 days notice. Key point: unvested equity is forfeited on termination. This prevents collecting advisors who contribute nothing. Also include automatic termination on change of control unless both parties agree to continue."

**[02:30-02:50] Common Mistakes**
"Three advisor agreement killers: First, giving equity with no vesting - I've seen founders lose 0.5% to advisors who disappeared after one meeting. Second, unclear deliverables - 'be available' isn't a deliverable. Third, forgetting the independent contractor clause - advisors aren't employees and can't claim benefits or unemployment."

**[02:50-03:05] Best Practices**
"Send this agreement within 48 hours of verbal commitment - excitement fades fast. Always issue options, not restricted stock, to avoid tax complications. Get board approval before promising any equity. And please, have your lawyer review before sending - this template is a starting point, not legal advice."

**[03:05-03:18] Call to Action**
"Download this template now and customize it for your next advisor conversation. The best advisors are often overcommitted - a professional agreement shows you value their time and sets you apart. Great advisors are force multipliers - now you have the framework to bring them on board properly."

## When to Use This Template

### Perfect Timing:
- **After verbal commitment** from advisor but before they start
- **Before sharing** any confidential information or strategy
- **When converting** informal mentors to formal advisors
- **During fundraising** when investors offer to advise

### Red Flags - Don't Use When:
- Advisor demands more than 1% equity (that's co-founder territory)
- They want cash compensation (use consultant agreement instead)
- They're currently employed by a competitor
- They can't clearly articulate their value-add

### Advisor Types and Typical Terms:
- **Domain Expert** (0.10-0.15%): Specific technical or industry knowledge
- **Connected Advisor** (0.15-0.25%): Opens doors to customers/investors  
- **Celebrity Advisor** (0.25-0.50%): Name recognition and credibility
- **Active Board Advisor** (0.50-1.00%): Monthly involvement, board meetings

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Initial Qualification (Before Agreement)
- Verify advisor's expertise is current and relevant
- Check for conflicts with existing advisors/investors
- Confirm they can legally advise (no non-competes)
- Get 2-3 references from other startups they advise

### 2. Define the Relationship (15 minutes)
- Pick one primary expertise area they'll focus on
- Set monthly time commitment (2-4 hours typical)
- List 3 specific ways they'll help
- Agree on communication preferences

### 3. Determine Equity (10 minutes)
- Use the equity ranges based on advisor type
- Calculate shares: % Ã— fully diluted shares
- Confirm your option pool has room
- Get board approval if required

### 4. Customize Agreement (15 minutes)
- Fill in all bracketed sections
- Choose vesting terms (2-year standard)
- Select acceleration provisions
- Add any special terms discussed

### 5. Legal Review and Execution (2-3 days)
- Have lawyer review modifications
- Send via DocuSign with brief note
- Include cap table showing their potential ownership
- Set calendar reminder for first monthly check-in

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **The Collector Founder**
Adding advisors like Pokemon cards. More isn't better - 3 great advisors beat 10 mediocre ones.

### 2. **The Perpetual Advisor**
No term limits or performance expectations. Dead equity walking.

### 3. **The Unclear Communicator**
"Help with strategy" isn't specific enough. Define exact areas of focus.

### 4. **The Generous Granter**
Giving advisor-level equity to anyone who offers to help. Reserve it for true value-adds.

### 5. **The Verbal Agreement**
Handshake deals always go wrong. Get it in writing before they do any work.

### 6. **The Employee Classifier**
Treating advisors like part-time employees. They're independent contractors - act accordingly.

## Success Metrics

### Engagement Metrics:
- **Monthly meetings**: 80%+ attendance rate
- **Response time**: Within 48 hours to requests
- **Introductions**: 2-3 quality intros per quarter
- **Strategic input**: Meaningful contribution to 1+ major decision quarterly

### Value Metrics:
- **Revenue impact**: Traceable influence on deals/partnerships
- **Time saved**: 10+ hours monthly through advisor guidance
- **Network growth**: 20+ valuable connections per year
- **Decision quality**: Avoided 1+ major mistake via advisor input

### Red Flags to Track:
- Missing 2+ monthly meetings
- Generic advice without specific insights
- No introductions despite requests
- Publicly overstating their involvement

## Pro Tips

### 1. **The Test Drive**
Work with potential advisors informally for 30 days before formalizing. See their communication style and responsiveness.

### 2. **The Equity Budget**
Reserve 1-2% total equity for all advisors. Individual grants come from this pool.

### 3. **The Performance Review**
Schedule 6-month check-ins to evaluate the relationship. It's okay to part ways if not working.

### 4. **The Introduction Protocol**
Create a template for how advisors should introduce you. Prevents misrepresentation.

### 5. **The Advisor Update**
Send monthly updates to keep advisors engaged. Inactive advisors = wasted equity.

### 6. **The Success Fee Alternative**
For sales-focused advisors, consider success fees instead of equity. Aligns incentives better.

## Founder Examples

**Sarah, B2B SaaS:**
"Our advisor introduced us to our first 5 enterprise customers. The 0.25% equity was the best ROI in our cap table - those intros led to $2M ARR."

**Marcus, Consumer App:**
"We had an advisor who never showed up after signing. Thanks to the 3-month cliff, they got zero equity. Always include vesting!"

**Jennifer, Marketplace:**
"Our technical advisor saved us from a platform decision that would have cost $500K to fix later. Worth every basis point of equity."
