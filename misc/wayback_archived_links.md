## Quick Tips for Using These Links

1. **If the direct link doesn't work:**
   - Remove the timestamp and use the wildcard (*) version
   - This will show you a calendar of all archived dates

2. **If you get a 404 on Wayback Machine:**
   - The page might not have been archived
   - Try removing trailing slashes from the URL
   - Check parent directories

3. **Alternative approaches:**
   - Search for the article title in quotes on Google with "site:web.archive.org"
   - Check archive.today as an alternative: https://archive.is/

## How to Navigate Wayback Machine Results

When you click on the wildcard links above, you'll see:
1. A calendar view with blue circles on dates when the page was captured
2. Click on a blue circle to see captures from that day
3. Choose a specific timestamp to view the archived page

The darker the blue circle, the more captures were taken that day.
