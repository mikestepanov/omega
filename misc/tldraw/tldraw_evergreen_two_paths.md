# Two Paths from Traditional Recruiting

## Traditional Recruiting: Pick 2 Out of 3
- Good (Quality)
- Fast (Speed)
- Cheap (Cost)

Most companies are forced to sacrifice one dimension.

## The Fork in the Road: Two Strategic Paths

### Path 1: Fast & Cheap
**"The Volume Game"**

Strategy:
- Mass job postings
- Minimal screening
- Quick decisions
- High turnover accepted

Results:
- Fill roles quickly ✓
- Low cost per posting ✓
- Fast & furious recruiting ✗
- Random quality outcomes
- Hope for hidden gems
- Lottery-style hiring

Best for:
- High-volume, low-skill roles
- Seasonal hiring
- Emergency staffing

### Path 2: Cheap & Good (EVERGREEN)
**"The Investment Strategy"**

Strategy:
- Always-on recruiting
- Build talent pipeline
- Nurture relationships
- Pre-screen continuously

Results:
- High quality hires ✓
- Cost-effective over time ✓
- Speed is sacrificed initially ✗
- BUT: Speed improves dramatically once pipeline is built

Best for:
- Core team roles
- Technical positions
- Culture-critical hires
- Growing companies

## Why Evergreen Wins Long-Term

### Year 1: Building Phase
- Slower than "fast & cheap"
- Same cost
- Much better quality

### Year 2+: Compound Returns
- Pipeline is full
- Hiring becomes fast AND good
- Cost per hire drops
- Retention improves

## The Math

**Fast & Cheap Path:**
- Time to hire: 1 week
- Cost per hire: $500
- Quality score: 3/10
- 6-month retention: 40%
- True cost (with turnover): $3,000+

**Evergreen Path:**
- Initial time to hire: 4 weeks
- Ongoing time to hire: 3 days
- Cost per hire: $500
- Quality score: 8/10
- 6-month retention: 85%
- True cost (with retention): $800

## Key Insight

Fast & Cheap = Short-term thinking
Evergreen = Long-term investment

The question isn't "How fast can we fill this role?"
It's "How can we always have great people ready?"
