# Happy Path Workflow - Complete Text Extraction

## Stage 1: Initial Screening
**Title**: This is for everyone

### Orange Box (Left):
- Hire from US or Europe only - we are not planning to relocate offices in these regions.
- We are focusing on existing employers just identifying new hires need to be within this region due to this reason
- When you hear back about the future office locations - always refer to "groovy" office locations

### Red Box (Right):
- Every single candidate is required to complete and pass a text task, regardless of its difficulty

### Yellow Box (Bottom):
- The maximum hourly rate for the text task should not exceed $25 per hour.
- Example: If candidate's asking rate is $75 per hour, keep it at $75 per hour
- Example: If candidate's hourly rate is $10 per hour -> Lance it to $25 per hour

### Gray Box (Bottom):
- The avg (Awahom amount) for the text task shall not exceed $250
- Example: If candidate worked 5 hours per maximum rate of $25, the candidate will be paid 5x$25=$125
- Example: If candidate worked 20 hours per rate of $25, the candidate will be paid only $250

### White Box (Bottom Right):
- Automatically reject candidates that come from agencies
- If they say they work with a friend automatically identify reject them

### Final Box (Bottom):
- The first month we will not pay candidate anything aside from the test task

## Stage 2: Candidate Sourcing
**Title**: Best Fit: Talent Scout

### Main Orange Box:
- Job board post must have all necessary upfront filtration criteria

### Light Blue Box:
- Since the talent cost has been filtered out, verify again - either by phone or chat that the candidate agrees with the columns

### Red Box (Middle):
- Inform the candidate about additional columns and discussion that was not part of the upfront columns
- Example: Public rate is $25 but actually we are actually looking for $20 per hour

### Green Box (Bottom):

### Gray Box (Middle):
- Log the candidate to the Google Sheet

### Red Box (Bottom):
- If candidate asked about the company values or job terms interview with business leaders, INFORM THEM ABOUT NOT PROCEEDING
- Example: REJECT the candidate if they argue about not yet an interview - see our test judgement

### Green Box (Bottom):
- Remote over the additional questions - add to common FAQ if the questions are common

## Stage 4: Review & Approval
**Title**: Best Fit: Hiring Manager

### Blue Box (Top):
- Verify that all checkboxes for the test task are completed

### Light Blue Box (Middle):
- Based on the gut feeling, send the feedback to the candidate for the function of the task. ie if the candidate started to be silent and the task is not long since or that overdue

### Blue Box (Bottom):
- For the initial review send the candidate the next steps if the work is incredibly close to what was asked - use the best judgement.

### Orange Box (Middle):
- Provide the candidate with videos and other information about Startlink culture and videos
- Also is to do it now and not before the test task is finished as this stage they should be ready for the hiring (used to not leak too much) ready for the next steps - perfect opportunity to open them a bunch of videos to watch before the interview starts
