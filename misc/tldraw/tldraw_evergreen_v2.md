# Evergreen Recruiting V2 - Breaking the "Pick Two" Problem

## Traditional Recruiting - "Good, Fast, Cheap - Pick Two" Problem

The classic three circles where you can only achieve two at a time:
- **Fast**
- **Cheap** 
- **Good**

## Current StartHub Recruiting Solutions

### 1. Fast & Cheap → "Fast & Furious Recruiting"
- Need to fill like candidates ASAP
- 4/5 work and 3/5 cultural fit
- Better than death sentence

### 2. Good & Cheap → "Replace, not Fire Strategy"
- Identify the weak link within the team and look for replacements
- With infinite time finding a person with 5/5 work skills and 5/5 cultural fit would be a breeze

### 3. Good & Fast → "Fresh Blood Strategy"
- Always have a set of fresh candidates on the sideline
- The candidates come and go but if someone leaves or gets fired, we have options
- While candidates are not 5/5, they are at least as good as the person they replace

## The Solution: Evergreen Recruiting - "Good & Cheap & Fast"

### Pros:
- Can instantly replace people who leave with at least the same level of skill
