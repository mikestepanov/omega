# Evergreen Recruiting: The Venn Diagram Solution

## The Famous "Good, Fast, Cheap - Pick Two" Triangle
(Also known as the Project Management Triangle or Iron Triangle)

### Traditional Hiring - Pick Two Problem
Most companies fall into one of these overlapping zones:

```
         Quality üü¢              Speed üîµ
              \                    /
               \                  /
                \                /
              [Premium]      [Rush Jobs]
             (Quality+Cost)  (Speed+Cost)
                  \            /
                   \          /
                    \        /
                     \      /
                   EVERGREEN ‚≠ê
                     /      \
                    /        \
                   /          \
                  /            \
              [Bargain]         \
            (Speed+Quality)      \
                /                 \
               /                   \
              /                     \
        Cost-Effective üü†
```

### The 7 Zones Explained:

**Single Circles (Pick One - Bad Outcomes):**
1. **Quality Only** = Too Slow & Too Expensive
2. **Speed Only** = Too Expensive & Poor Quality  
3. **Cost Only** = Too Slow & Poor Quality

**Overlapping Zones (Pick Two - Trade-offs):**
4. **Quality + Speed** = Premium Recruiters (Too Expensive)
5. **Quality + Cost** = Long Search Process (Too Slow)
6. **Speed + Cost** = Rush Hires (Poor Quality)

**Center Zone (All Three - Sweet Spot):**
7. **Quality + Speed + Cost** = EVERGREEN RECRUITING ‚≠ê

### How Evergreen Sits in the Center:

**Quality** ‚úì
- Pre-screened talent pool
- Time to find best fits, not just available
- Candidates self-select for culture fit
- Continuous improvement of candidate quality

**Speed** ‚úì
- Instant access to pre-qualified candidates
- Skip initial screening phases
- Fill roles in days, not weeks
- No starting from scratch

**Cost-Effective** ‚úì
- Amortize recruiting costs over time
- Reduce urgent hiring premiums
- Lower cost-per-hire through volume
- Eliminate emergency recruiting fees

## The Evergreen Advantage

Instead of being forced to choose:
- **Cheap but Slow** (Job boards with no screening)
- **Fast but Expensive** (Recruiters and agencies)
- **Quality but Slow** (Exhaustive search process)

Evergreen recruiting achieves all three:
- **Quality AND Speed AND Cost-Effective**

## Visual Representation for tldraw

```
Three overlapping circles:
- Top Left: "Quality Talent" (Green)
- Top Right: "Fast Hiring" (Blue)
- Bottom: "Cost Efficient" (Orange)

Center overlap (where all 3 meet):
"EVERGREEN RECRUITING" (Gold star)

Outside each circle:
- Beyond Quality: "Too Picky"
- Beyond Speed: "Too Rushed"
- Beyond Cost: "Too Cheap"
```

## Key Messages

1. **Quality**: "Build relationships before you need them"
2. **Speed**: "Your next hire is already in the pipeline"
3. **Cost**: "Invest in tomorrow's talent today"

## Implementation Note

The magic happens when you maintain all three:
- Continuous pipeline (Speed)
- Relationship building (Quality)
- Automated systems (Cost)
