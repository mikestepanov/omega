## Overview

During the corporate meeting, CEO Avraham Ilyayev introduced the **Three C's Framework** as a foundational principle for how StartHub operates. He emphasized that "the future and the fortune is really in the followup."

## The Three C's

### 1. **CONNECT** - Initiate the Relationship
- Start relationships with purpose
- You are the spark - don't wait for people to come to you
- Reach out with value and a clear reason for connecting
- Make the first move with meaningful intent

**Examples from the meeting:**
- **Partnerships**: Met a VC at an event? Follow up the next day with value
- **Content**: Saw a subject matter expert on LinkedIn? Reach out immediately with StartHub's mission
- **Dev/Design**: Not sure what's needed? Connect and clarify directly

**Real Example - Tahira Dezani:**
- Fintech VC who raised $50M for her fund
- Rejected StartHub 3 times
- Avraham saw her fundraising news and congratulated her
- Connected her content creation for Founder Institute to StartHub opportunity
- She agreed within 5 minutes of the targeted outreach

### 2. **COMMIT** - Do What You Say You'll Do
- Your word is your bond
- Be someone people can trust
- Show up prepared, respond on time, follow through
- Build reputation through consistent delivery

**Examples from the meeting:**
- **Partnerships**: Promise a proposal by Friday? Send it Thursday night
- **Content**: Said you'll upload an instructor's course by Monday? Do it
- **Dev**: Committed to a deadline? Deliver unless there's a real emergency
- **Podcasting**: Promised to send questions a week before? Send them

**Key Quote:** *"This is all about being someone that people can trust, right? Someone who shows up prepared, responds on time, and follows through."*

### 3. **CIRCLE BACK** - Never Let the Ball Drop
- Close the loops
- Re-engage leads
- Show people you actually care
- Turn cold leads into closed deals

**Examples from the meeting:**
- **Partnerships**: Great conversation 3 weeks ago but no response? Circle back
- **Content**: Instructor interested but didn't finish onboarding? Re-check in and offer help
- **Dev/Design**: Feature requested but not tested? Circle back for feedback

**Key Point:** *"One of the biggest killers in a startup's relationships is that people forget to follow up because we have a lot going on."*

## Implementation

### Mandatory Adoption
*"The three Cs are not optional. This is how we operate at StartHub moving forward."*

### Scope of Application
- External relationships (clients, partners, users, instructors)
- Internal communications (between team members)
- All levels (from interns to executives)

### Integration
*"Starting from today, every team member will be expected to integrate the three Cs into how you work and communicate."*

## Why This Matters

1. **Separates High Performers from Average Teams**
   - This framework is what makes StartHub unique and special

2. **Builds Our Brand**
   - How we stay on people's radar
   - Creates consistent, professional interactions

3. **Scales Trust**
   - Inside and outside the organization
   - Creates accountability and momentum with every interaction

## The Tahira Dezani Case Study

A perfect example of the Three C's in action:

1. **CONNECT**: Saw her $50M fundraising announcement, reached out with congratulations
2. **COMMIT**: Promised to make content creation worth her time
3. **CIRCLE BACK**: After 3 rejections, found new angle through Founder Institute connection

**Result**: She agreed within 5 minutes and is now creating content for StartHub

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Connect with purpose, not randomly**
- **Commit only to what you can deliver**
- **Circle back consistently - persistence pays off**
- **This framework is now baked into how StartHub moves**
- **No exceptions - everyone must adopt this approach**

---

*"Remember that sometimes the circle back is all that it really takes to turn a cold lead into a closed lead."*
