# Company Rules and Principles

*Extracted from Avraham Ilyayev's interviews and leadership philosophy*

## Core Foundation: The Three C's

### 1. CONSISTENCY
**Definition**: Everything you do must be done consistently, reliably, and predictably.

**Rules**:
- Work hours must be within Â±3 hours of committed time
  - If you commit to 40 hours, acceptable range is 37-43 hours
  - Up to 2 hours can be excused per week (38 hours minimum)
- Maintain consistent quality of work
- Be predictable in your availability and output
- If you cannot maintain consistency, communicate in advance

**Violations**:
- Working significantly under committed hours without communication
- Unpredictable availability
- Inconsistent work quality

### 2. COMMITMENT
**Definition**: Do what you say you'll do. Your word is your bond.

**Rules**:
- Only commit to things you can actually deliver
- If you can't do something, say so upfront
- Complete tasks you've committed to
- Be honest about your capabilities and limitations
- Follow through on all promises
- 110% commitment expected after acclimation period

**Examples**:
- If you say you'll work 40 hours, work 40 hours
- If you commit to a deadline, meet it
- If you can't fulfill a commitment, communicate immediately

**Violations**:
- Overcommitting and underdelivering
- Saying you can do something when you can't
- Not following through on promises

  - When offline (sleeping/different timezone), respond ASAP upon return

- **Meeting Protocol**:
  - Minimum 3 hours advance notice for missing meetings
  - Communicate absences as early as possible
  - Emergency exceptions understood but must be communicated

- **Tools**:

- Risk-taker on people
- Founder's dedication (doesn't sleep)

### Mike's Approach
- "More of the flexible guy"
- Technical leadership

- Initial screening and onboarding

### Balance

2. Consistent failure to meet hour commitments
3. Dishonesty about capabilities
4. Pattern of broken commitments
5. Refusing to use required tools (Pumble on phone + computer)

## Remember
- "We're grown men on a mission"
- "Do what you say you'll do"
- "The only person in charge of your success is you"
- "If you follow these three Cs, you're setting yourself up for success"
- "If you don't, there's no place for you here"
