# The Three C's - Company Culture Framework <!-- [title-48px] -->
## Core Operational Foundation (Internal Focus Only) <!-- [title-32px] -->

---

## Overview <!-- [title-32px] -->

The Three C's of Company Culture are the **non-negotiable foundation** of how we operate internally. They define our work standards, professional conduct, and team dynamics.

> "If you follow these three Cs, you're setting yourself up for success here. I'm being completely honest. As cliche as it may sound, it's the truth." - Avraham Ilyayev

---

## The Success Formula <!-- [title-32px] -->

```
Following ALL 3 C's = SUCCESS
Breaking EVEN ONE C = FAILURE
```

There is no middle ground. You either follow all three or you fail.

## 1. CONSISTENCY - The Foundation <!-- [title-32px] -->

### Definition <!-- [title-24px] -->
> "Everything that you do here has to be consistent"

Everything you do must be done consistently, reliably, and predictably. You are the rock others can depend on.

### Core Rules <!-- [title-24px] -->

**Work Hours**
- Must stay within Â±3 hours of committed time
- 40 hours committed = 37-43 hours acceptable range
- Up to 2 hours/week can be excused (38 hours minimum)
- Track all hours accurately in Clockify

**Quality Standards**
- Maintain professional-grade work every single day
- No excuses for subpar deliverables
- Same high standard whether Monday or Friday
- Consistent output regardless of mood or circumstances

**Availability**
- Be where you said you'd be, when you said you'd be there
- Predictable schedule others can rely on
- Consistent daily start/end times
- Reliable presence during core hours

### Red Flags <!-- [title-24px] -->
- Working 45 hours one week, 25 the next

## 2. COMMITMENT - The Promise <!-- [title-32px] -->

### Definition <!-- [title-24px] -->
> "Do what you say you'll do"

Your word is your bond. Only promise what you can deliver, then deliver it without fail.

### Core Rules <!-- [title-24px] -->

**Making Commitments**
- Only commit to what you can 100% deliver
- Be honest about your capabilities
- Consider all obstacles before saying yes
- It's better to say "no" than to fail

**Keeping Commitments**
- If you said Friday, deliver Thursday night
- No excuses, only results
- Take complete ownership
- 110% commitment expected after acclimation

**The Commitment Test**
Before committing, ask yourself:
1. Would I bet money on delivering this?
2. Am I 100% sure I can do this?
3. Have I considered all obstacles?
4. Am I being honest with myself?

### Red Flags <!-- [title-24px] -->
- Pattern of overcommitting and underdelivering
- Making excuses instead of delivering results
- Saying "yes" when you mean "maybe"
- Consistently missing deadlines
- Blaming external factors for failures

### Daily Commitment Checklist <!-- [title-24px] -->
- [ ] Have I delivered on all yesterday's promises?
- [ ] Am I being realistic about today's commitments?
- [ ] Have I communicated any potential delays?
- [ ] Am I taking full ownership of my tasks?
- [ ] Did I under-promise and over-deliver?
