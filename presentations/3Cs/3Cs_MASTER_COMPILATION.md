# The Three C's Master Compilation
## Complete Framework Documentation

---

## Overview

The Three C's framework appears in multiple contexts within the organization, each with a specific focus:

1. **Company Culture 3Cs** - Consistency, Commitment, Communication (operational foundation)
2. **Relationship 3Cs** - Connect, Commit, Circle Back (external relationships)

Both frameworks are **non-negotiable** and form the foundation of how the company operates.
