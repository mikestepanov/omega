# Monday Morning Pay Period Reminder

Automated system for sending pay period reminders every other Monday at 7 AM CST when the pay period ends.

## Overview

The Monday reminder system automatically:
- Calculates the current pay period number (starting from period 18 ending June 23, 2025)
- Sends reminders on Monday mornings when Monday is the last day of the pay period
- Uses Agent Smith persona for formal business communication
- Updates dates and period numbers automatically
- Payments process 7 days later (the following Monday)

## Message Format

Agent Smith sends a formal reminder in his characteristic style:

```
üï¥Ô∏è System Notice: Pay Period 19th Termination

Good Morning Team.

The current pay period cycle reaches its inevitable termination today.

System Requirements:
‚Ä¢ Submit all temporal data by end of day today (July 7th)
‚Ä¢ Current cycle encompasses: 6/24 ‚Äì 7/7
‚Ä¢ Today (July 7th) is the final day of period 19
‚Ä¢ Tomorrow (July 8th) initiates period 20

Additional Directives:

### Automated Scheduling

The GitHub Action runs every Monday at 7 AM CST:
- Automatically checks if it's the last day of a pay period
- Only sends message when appropriate
- Can be manually triggered with test mode

## Pay Period Schedule

Starting from Period 18 (June 10-23, 2025):

| Period | Start Date | End Date (Monday) | Payment Date (Monday) |
|--------|------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| 18     | Jun 10     | Jun 23           | Jun 30                |
| 19     | Jun 24     | Jul 7            | Jul 14                |
| 20     | Jul 8      | Jul 21           | Jul 28                |
| 21     | Jul 22     | Aug 4            | Aug 11                |

## Testing

### Preview Next Monday's Message
```bash
# If today is Thursday, July 4, 2024
node monday-reminder.js preview 2024-07-07

# Output shows:
# - Full formatted message
# - Period 19 details
# - Confirms it's the last day of period
```

### Check Future Pay Periods
```bash
node monday-reminder.js schedule 5

# Shows next 5 pay periods with:
# - Period numbers
# - Date ranges
# - Payment dates
# - Which Monday is the last day
```

## How It Works

1. **Base Reference**: Period 18 ends on June 23, 2025 (Monday)
2. **Calculation**: System calculates current period based on 14-day cycles
3. **Date Check**: Only sends on Mondays that are the last day of a period
4. **Auto-increment**: Period numbers and dates update automatically
5. **Payment Date**: Always 7 days after period end (the following Monday)
